# Outcomist Logo

## Concept

The Outcomist logo embodies the core product insight: **revealing hidden patterns**.

The "O" in OUTCOMIST is composed of 20 dots arranged in a perfect circle. When viewed up close, you see scattered dots. Step back, and the circular pattern reveals itself. This visual metaphor captures exactly what Outcomist does: helps users see patterns they're too close to recognize on their own.

## Design Principles

- **Hidden patterns**: The dots ARE a pattern, not a representation of one
- **Outcomes over activity**: The circle suggests focus and clarity (outcomes)
- **Deep understanding**: Pattern recognition requires stepping back to see the whole
- **Professional confidence**: No hints or explanations—the logo trusts the viewer to discover

## Typography

- **Font**: System UI (system-ui, -apple-system, sans-serif)
- **Weight**: Bold (700)
- **Size**: 72px
- **Letter spacing**: 16px (extra wide for breathing room)
