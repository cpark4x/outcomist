## What is Outcomist?

Outcomist helps you think through your project to deeply understand what you want and why.

This is an important step before starting the project.

**Current Status**: Epic 1-2 (Pattern Recognition & Discovery) validated with 13 test scenarios, 9 patterns documented. Version 4.7 shipped.

---

## The Problem

**You ask AI for help without first thinking deeply about what you want.**

You ask AI: "Help me redesign my office."

AI starts generating layouts, furniture recommendations, color schemes.

But here's what AI didn't ask:
- Why do you want to redesign it?
- What's not working about your current space?
- What are you actually trying to achieve?

You get a beautifully redesigned office for productivity. But what you actually needed was a personal sanctuary.

**You didn't realize you were solving the wrong problem. And AI didn't tell you.**

This happens because:
- You focus on the task ("redesign office") not the outcome ("create inspiring space")
- You assume you know the solution ("microwave above oven") and miss better options
- You can't always articulate what you really want
- AI just executes whatever you ask - it never questions, never probes, never reveals better paths

**You don't need smarter AI. You need a thinking partner.**

Someone who helps you understand what you're actually trying to achieve before you waste time building the wrong thing.

## Why This Matters Now

AI is everywhere. ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini - everyone has access to incredible thinking tools.

But here's what's happening:

**People are using AI like a better search engine, not a thinking partner.**

They get fast answers to surface questions. They optimize for the wrong outcomes. They build the wrong things efficiently.

**The gap is growing**: The better AI gets at answering questions, the more critical it becomes to ask the right question first.

---

## The Solution

**Outcomist is the expert advisor you talk to BEFORE you ask AI to solve something.**

### How It Works

**You bring a decision:**
"Should I redesign my office to make it more inspiring for work?"

**Outcomist reveals the pattern:**
"This isn't about work optimization - you're describing a personal sanctuary. Games, memorabilia, a place to retreat. That's a different design entirely."

**Then walks you through it:**
- Targeted questions that reveal what matters
- Clear recommendation based on YOUR context
- Next actions to move forward

**The magic**: You don't need to understand the methodology. You just experience someone actually helping you think, not just answering.

---

## How It Works (Technical)

Outcomist uses **progressive disclosure** through five epics:

### Epic 1: Pattern Recognition (30 seconds) - ✅ Validated
Identify the deeper pattern using 9 documented patterns. Reframe the question. Show what you're really deciding.

### Epic 2: Discovery (5-10 minutes) - ✅ Validated
Ask adaptive questions one at a time. Gather evidence. Synthesize insights. Deliver personalized recommendation.

### Epic 3: Deep Analysis (20-30 minutes) - ⏳ Proposed
For complex decisions: systematic alternative comparison, risk assessment, scenario planning.

### Epic 4: Design (Variable) - ⏳ Proposed
Create wireframes, specifications, and prototypes before building.

### Epic 5: Build & Track (Ongoing) - ⏳ Proposed
Execute implementation, handle blockers, measure outcomes, capture learning.

**Key**: Start simple (Epic 1), go deeper only if the decision warrants it. Most decisions resolve at Epic 2.

---

## The Five-Epic Journey

See [End-to-End Flow Documentation](./end-to-end-flow.md) for complete details on all five epics.

## The Three Decision Phases

Outcomist is **Stage 1** of a three-stage decision journey:

### Stage 1: Explore (Current)
**Purpose**: Understand what you're really deciding
**Command**: `/explore`
**Output**: Clarity + recommendation

### Stage 2: Design (Future)
**Purpose**: Align on what to build before building it
**Command**: `/design`
**Output**: Wireframes, specs, prototypes to sign off on
**Why**: Prevents "building the wrong thing efficiently"

### Stage 3: Build (Future)
**Purpose**: Execute and track implementation
**Command**: `/build`
**Output**: Working solution with blockers handled

**Current focus**: Nail Stage 1 before building Stages 2 & 3.

## Who This Is For

**Anyone making decisions.**

With AI, roles are merging. A product person might also be an engineer, designer, small business owner, side hustler.

The commonality: They have decisions to make. They need clarity on what they're actually trying to achieve.

### Example Users

**The Founder**
- Deciding between client work vs product focus
- Pattern: Scarcity mindset despite strong fundamentals

**The Product Manager**
- Deciding which feature to build
- Pattern: Product identity crisis hidden in prioritization

**The Individual**
- Deciding how to redesign their space
- Pattern: Work optimization masking personal needs

**The No-Code Builder** (New - Test #9)
- Using AI to build products, stuck in build phase
- Pattern: Stuck building 179 features when they need 1 demo
- Real issue: Scope management, not LLM limitations

**The Domain**: Personal, workplace, management, business, product decisions.

## What Makes This Different

**ChatGPT/Claude**: Answers whatever you ask, brilliantly. But if you ask the wrong question, you get the wrong answer.

**Traditional advisors**: Expensive, slow, require scheduling, formal engagement.

**Generic decision tools**: Frameworks, matrices, overwhelm you with options without understanding your context.

**Outcomist**:
- Reveals what you're actually asking (pattern recognition)
- Understands YOUR context (adaptive discovery)
- Gives clear recommendations (not "here are 7 options")
- Works at the right depth (30 seconds to 60 minutes based on stakes)
- Free of invented statistics (honest evidence only)

---

## Core Principles

### 1. Outcome Over Activity
Focus on what you're trying to achieve, not the task at hand.

### 2. Progressive Disclosure
Start simple, go deeper only if needed. Ladder, not fork.

### 3. Honest Evidence
Pattern recognition yes. Invented statistics no.

### 4. Adaptive Questioning
Questions evolve based on answers. Not a fixed script.

### 5. Clear Stance
"I recommend X" not "here are 7 options, you decide."

---

## Product Strategy

### Current Phase: Internal Validation
- Team testing the tool
- Early signals promising
- Building pattern library from real usage
- Capturing decision data to improve recommendations

### Success Metrics
- **Adoption**: People use it for real decisions (not demos)
- **Return usage**: Come back for multiple decisions
- **Organic referral**: Tell others unprompted
- **Data capture**: Build pattern library from usage

### Long-Term Vision
- **Superuser focus**: Small but deeply engaged core (100-500 users)
- **Word-of-mouth growth**: Let passionate users drive volume
- **Data flywheel**: More usage → better patterns → better tool
- **Building block**: Foundation for larger decision support platform
- **Potential acquisition**: Valuable to productivity tools, AI companies, consulting firms

## Why This Will Work

### The Problem Is Real
People make expensive mistakes by solving the wrong problem. Office redesigns that don't help. Client work that kills product momentum. Features that serve the wrong customer.

### The Timing Is Perfect
Everyone has AI now. They're hitting the limits of "just ask ChatGPT." The gap between "AI can answer anything" and "do I even know what to ask?" is widening.

### The Approach Is Proven
5 test scenarios validated. Team testing confirms it. The methodology works when people actually use it.

### The Unfair Advantage Is Real
The progressive disclosure insight (Tier 1→2→3→4) isn't obvious. Most tools either give instant shallow answers OR force long conversations. The middle path is the insight.

### The Data Compounds
Every decision captured improves pattern recognition. More usage → better recommendations → more usage. Classic flywheel.
