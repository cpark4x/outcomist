# Question Quality Framework

**Last Updated**: 2025-11-04
**Status**: Documented from 5 test scenarios, needs systematic implementation
**Purpose**: Know which questions to ask when

---

## The Core Insight

**ONE question consistently unlocks the real problem.**

Across 5 test scenarios:
- **Office test**: Q4 (usage patterns) revealed personal sanctuary need
- **Passive income test**: Q4 (capital amount) revealed $500K+ → entire recommendation pivot
- **Cancer test**: Q1 (trigger event) revealed friend's stage 4 diagnosis → anxiety driver
- **Feature decision test**: Q3 (product positioning) revealed values contradiction → identity crisis
- **Client vs product test**: Q2 (financial runway) revealed $60K savings → false scarcity

**The challenge**: Can we get better at identifying WHICH question to ask WHEN?

## Question Framework by Domain

### 1. Trigger Questions
**When to use**: Always first for health/anxiety/career decisions

**Purpose**: Understand timing and emotional drivers

**Questions**:
- "What happened that's making you think about this RIGHT NOW?"
- "Why now, not 6 months ago or 6 months from now?"
- "Who or what triggered this decision?"

**What this reveals**:
- Recent events driving urgency (friend's diagnosis, job loss, life change)
- Emotional vs. rational drivers
- Whether this is reactive or proactive

**Example**: Cancer prevention test - Q1 revealed friend's stage 4 diagnosis as anxiety trigger, reframed from generic prevention to targeted response.

### 2. Constraint Questions
**When to use**: For resource decisions (money, time, people)

**Purpose**: Reveal actual vs. perceived constraints

**Questions**:
- "What's your capital situation / savings?" *(Passive income: $500K changed everything)*
- "What's your financial runway?" *(Client vs product: 12-14 months killed scarcity narrative)*
- "How much time can you realistically invest?"
- "What's your risk tolerance? (1-10)"
- "Who else is involved in this decision?"

**What this reveals**:
- False scarcity ("market is tough" but 12 months runway)
- Hidden resources ($500K capital enables passive income)
- Real constraints vs. imagined ones
- Decision power and stakeholders

**Example**: Client vs product test - Q2 revealed $60K savings / $5K burn = 12-14 months runway. "Stable $6K/month client" was distraction, not necessity.

---

### 3. Usage/Context Questions
**When to use**: For space/design/product decisions

**Purpose**: Understand actual use vs. stated purpose

**Questions**:
- "How will you actually use this?" *(Office: revealed games + personal storage)*
- "Who else uses or accesses this space/product?"
- "What's your appetite for [renovation/change/effort]?"
- "What activities make you feel most yourself in this space?"

**What this reveals**:
- Multi-use scenarios (work + personal)
- Emotional vs. functional needs
- Stakeholder conflicts
- Transformation appetite

**Example**: Office test - Q4 revealed multi-use space (work + games + personal sanctuary), not just work optimization.

---

### 4. Pattern Questions
**When to use**: For medical/technical/repeated decisions

**Purpose**: Identify patterns that change risk/strategy

**Questions**:
- "What's your family history?" *(Cancer: revealed hereditary pattern)*
- "What types of [condition] and at what ages?"
- "What's your ethnicity?" *(Affects genetic testing)*
- "What have you tried before?" *(Health/productivity scenarios)*
- "How many times has this happened?" *(Recurring issues)*

**What this reveals**:
- Hereditary vs. lifestyle vs. random risk
- Success/failure patterns from past attempts
- Systemic vs. one-off problems

**Example**: Cancer test - Q3 revealed multiple early-onset cancers (colon, pancreatic, breast at ages 40, 45, 50) → hereditary pattern → genetic counseling, not generic screening.

---

### 5. Values/Identity Questions
**When to use**: For strategic/positioning/values-based decisions

**Purpose**: Reveal conflicts between stated values and actual choices

**Questions**:
- "What's your product positioning? Who do you claim to serve?" *(Feature decision: revealed contradiction)*
- "Who actually requested this?" *(Top-down vs. bottom-up)*
- "Does this align with your stated values?"
- "What kind of [business/product/person] do you want to be?"

**What this reveals**:
- Values vs. actions misalignment
- Product identity crises
- Stakeholder conflicts (employers vs. employees)
- Positioning contradictions

**Example**: Feature decision test - Q3 revealed "employees first" positioning but Feature X served employers (RTO enforcement). Can't be both.

---

## Adaptive Questioning Rules

Questions should **evolve based on previous answers**, not follow a fixed script.

### After Revealing Constraint → Probe Implications

**If user reveals capital**:
- Next: "What's your time horizon for this investment?"
- Then: "What's your risk tolerance?"
- Then: "Do you need liquidity or can this be locked up?"

**If user reveals family history**:
- Next: "What specific types and at what ages?"
- Then: "What's your ethnicity?" (affects genetic testing)
- Then: "What screening are you currently doing?"

### After Revealing Anxiety → Probe Depth

**If user mentions friend's diagnosis**:
- Next: "How close is this friend? How recent?"
- Then: "What type of cancer? What stage?"
- Then: "How has this affected you emotionally?"

**If user mentions career fears**:
- Next: "What specifically makes you feel vulnerable?"
- Then: "How long have you been in this field?"
- Then: "What triggered this fear right now?"

### After Revealing Multi-Use Context → Probe Priorities

**If user mentions work + personal use**:
- Next: "What's the time split between work and personal?"
- Then: "Which use feels more important to you?"
- Then: "Who else accesses this space?"

**If user mentions multiple stakeholders**:
- Next: "Who has final decision power?"
- Then: "Are all stakeholders aligned on goals?"
- Then: "What happens if there's disagreement?"

## Question Quality Checklist

Before asking a question, verify:

- [ ] **Specific**: Not "tell me about your situation" but "what's your monthly burn rate?"
- [ ] **One thing at a time**: Not "what's your capital and risk tolerance and timeline?" but ONE question
- [ ] **Easy to answer**: User has this information readily available
- [ ] **Reveals constraint or context**: Not just gathering info, but unlocking understanding
- [ ] **Builds on previous answer**: Adaptive, not scripted

**Bad question**: "Can you tell me more about your financial situation and what you're hoping to achieve with this?"
- Too broad, asks 2 things, generic

**Good question**: "What's your monthly burn rate and how much savings do you have?"
- Specific, quantifiable, reveals constraint

## Breakthrough Question Patterns

### The Capital Reveal (Passive Income Test)
**Setup**: User wants "additional revenue" through high-effort business
**Question**: "What's your capital situation? Do you have savings or investments?"
**Result**: "$500K+" → Entire recommendation changed from business to passive income

**Why it worked**: Revealed hidden resource that enabled better strategy

### The Runway Reality Check (Client vs Product Test)
**Setup**: User treating $6K/month client as "stable money" necessity
**Question**: "What's your monthly burn and how much savings do you have? How long can you afford to say no to this client?"
**Result**: "$60K / $5K = 12-14 months" → Killed scarcity narrative

**Why it worked**: Math destroyed false urgency

### The Usage Pattern (Office Test)
**Setup**: User wants "inspiring office" for work
**Question**: "Beyond work, how will you actually use this space? What activities?"
**Result**: "Games, personal memorabilia, retreat" → Not work optimization, personal sanctuary

**Why it worked**: Revealed emotional/personal need hidden beneath functional request

### The Product Identity (Feature Decision Test)
**Setup**: User framing as "10 customers vs 2 customers" prioritization
**Question**: "What's your product positioning? Who do you claim to serve?"
**Result**: "Employees first" contradicted by Feature X serving employers → Identity crisis revealed

**Why it worked**: Exposed values contradiction that reframed entire decision

## Heuristics: Which Question When?

### If user mentions money/revenue → Ask constraint questions
- Financial runway
- Capital available
- Burn rate vs. income

### If user mentions recent event → Ask trigger questions
- What happened RIGHT NOW?
- Who/what triggered this?

### If user mentions space/product → Ask usage questions
- How will you actually use this?
- Who else is involved?

### If user mentions health/risk → Ask pattern questions
- Family history
- Past attempts
- What types and when?

### If user frames with numbers (10 vs 2, $6K vs $2K) → Ask values questions
- What's your positioning?
- Who requested this?
- Does this align with values?

## Common Question Mistakes

### ❌ Asking Multiple Things at Once
"What's your capital, risk tolerance, and timeline?"
→ User picks ONE to answer, you lose the others

**Fix**: Ask separately, one at a time

### ❌ Vague Open-Ended Questions
"Can you tell me more about your situation?"
→ User doesn't know what you need, rambles

**Fix**: Be specific: "What's your monthly burn rate?"

### ❌ Asking What You Already Know
User said "market is tough" and you ask "how's the market?"
→ Wastes trust, feels like you're not listening

**Fix**: Challenge it: "You say market is tough, but your product grew 4X - what makes you say tough?"

### ❌ Asking Questions You Can't Act On
"What's your favorite color?"
→ Unless color affects recommendation, don't ask

**Fix**: Only ask questions that change your recommendation
