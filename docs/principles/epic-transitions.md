# Epic Transitions: User Agency & Information Flow

**Last Updated**: 2025-01-10

---

## Overview

Outcomist respects user agency at every epic transition. Users choose depth based on decision complexity, stakes, time available, confidence level, and information needs.

**The system never forces unnecessary depth.** Most decisions resolve at Epic 2.

---

## Transition Philosophy

### Progressive Disclosure

The entire architecture embodies progressive disclosure:

- **Epic 1**: 30 seconds - Quick pattern insight
- **Epic 2**: 5-10 minutes - Structured discovery
- **Epic 3**: 20-30 minutes - Deep analysis
- **Epic 4**: Variable - Solution design
- **Epic 5**: Ongoing - Execution tracking

Users escalate depth only when needed. Not all decisions require all epics.

### User Choice at Every Stage

After each epic, users decide:
- **Stop here**: Have what I need
- **Continue**: Need deeper exploration

No epic is mandatory. Users control their journey.

## Transition Points

### After Epic 1: Pattern Recognition → Epic 2 Discovery

**Decision**: Continue to Epic 2 or stop?

**Why Stop**:
- Pattern recognition alone provides sufficient clarity
- User sees the real issue and knows what to do
- Decision is simple enough without deeper exploration
- Time-constrained (need quick insight)

**Why Continue**:
- Want to explore the reframed question deeper
- Need specific, personalized recommendations
- Unclear about best path forward
- Stakes high enough to warrant exploration

**What Flows Forward**:
- Original decision statement
- Identified pattern (e.g., "Scarcity Mindset")
- Reframed question
- Intent (validation vs. execution)

**Example Transition**:
> User: "Should I take $6K/month client work or focus on my $2K MRR product?"
>
> Epic 1 Output: "This looks like Scarcity Mindset despite strong fundamentals. Let's explore your actual financial runway and product growth."
>
> **User chooses**: Continue to Epic 2 to get personalized recommendation

### After Epic 2: Discovery → Epic 3 Deep Analysis

**Decision**: Act on recommendation, continue to Epic 3, or stop?

**Why Stop**:
- Recommendation is clear and actionable
- Have sufficient information to decide confidently
- Decision isn't complex enough for deeper analysis
- Stakes are moderate (consequences not extreme)

**Why Continue to Epic 3**:
- Decision is complex with multiple viable options
- Need systematic comparison of alternatives
- Want risk assessment and scenario planning
- Stakes are high enough to warrant deeper analysis
- Recommendation helpful but want to explore more options

**What Flows Forward**:
- All discovery insights (answers to questions)
- Identified constraints (e.g., "12 months runway")
- Priorities (e.g., "Product growth > stable income")
- Gathered evidence (facts verified)
- Initial recommendation (e.g., "Focus on product")

**Example Transition**:
> Epic 2 Output: "I recommend focusing on your product. You have 12-14 months runway, product is at inflection point (4X growth), client work is underpriced."
>
> **User might choose**:
> - **Stop**: "That's what I needed to hear. I'm going all-in on the product."
> - **Continue**: "I want to explore hybrid options and understand the risks better before committing."

---

### After Epic 3: Deep Analysis → Epic 4 Design

**Decision**: Choose option and act, continue to Epic 4, or stop?

**Why Stop**:
- Have chosen an option confidently
- Clear on next steps, can execute independently
- Decision doesn't require design phase
- Ready to act (bias toward action)

**Why Continue to Epic 4**:
- Want to design solution before building
- Risk of "building the wrong thing" is high
- Solution is complex enough to benefit from wireframes/specs
- Need validation from stakeholders before committing resources
- Team needs clear design to align

**What Flows Forward**:
- All options analyzed (e.g., 4 different approaches)
- Chosen direction (e.g., "Hybrid: 20 hrs/week client, 20 hrs/week product")
- Refined decision criteria (what matters most)
- Risk assessments for each option
- Scenario plans (best/worst/likely outcomes)

**Example Transition**:
> Epic 3 Output: "After analyzing 4 options and planning scenarios, the hybrid approach balances financial safety with product momentum. Risks are manageable."
>
> **User might choose**:
> - **Stop**: "That makes sense. I'll start reaching out to clients and set boundaries."
> - **Continue**: "I want to design what 'hybrid' actually looks like before committing—schedules, boundaries, deliverables."

### After Epic 4: Design → Epic 5 Build & Track

**Decision**: Build on your own or continue to Epic 5?

**Why Stop**:
- Have design and specifications
- Confident executing independently
- Don't need tracking support
- Team can handle implementation without system

**Why Continue to Epic 5**:
- Want help tracking execution progress
- Benefit from blocker identification and troubleshooting
- Need outcome measurement support
- Want to capture learning for future
- Implementation is complex/long (many months)

**What Flows Forward**:
- Wireframes and visual designs
- Written specifications and requirements
- Prototypes (if created)
- Success criteria (how to measure success)
- Validation feedback incorporated

**Example Transition**:
> Epic 4 Output: "Here's your hybrid schedule design: MWF client work (9am-2pm), TTh product work (all day), weekends protected. Client contract template included. Success = $3K client MRR + $3K product MRR in 6 months."
>
> **User might choose**:
> - **Stop**: "This is perfect. I can execute from here."
> - **Continue**: "I want to track my progress weekly and get help if I hit blockers."

---

### After Epic 5: Build & Track → Learning

**Completion**: Decision fully executed, outcomes measured

**What Flows Back**:
- Learning captured from execution experience
- Patterns identified during implementation (e.g., "Hybrid approach works for technical founders")
- Blocker patterns documented (e.g., "Client boundaries erode without contracts")
- Outcome data (actual vs. expected results)

**Feeds Forward Into**:
- **Pattern Library**: New patterns from execution experience
- **Question Framework**: New questions that unlock insights
- **Blocker Library**: Common blockers and solutions
- **Future Users**: Learning improves recommendations

**Example**:
> Epic 5 Completion: "After 6 months: $4K client MRR, $5K product MRR. Success! Key learning: Setting explicit client boundaries in contract was critical. Without it, scope creep threatened product time."
>
> **Pattern captured**: "Hybrid Boundary Pattern" - When pursuing hybrid approach, explicit written boundaries prevent scope creep
>
> **Feeds forward**: Future users with similar decisions get better recommendations based on this learning

## Decision Factors: How Users Choose

### Decision Complexity
- **Simple** (one obvious right answer) → Stop at Epic 1 or 2
- **Moderate** (few good options) → Epic 2 or 3
- **Complex** (many viable options, trade-offs) → Epic 3+

### Stakes Involved
- **Low** (easily reversible, low cost) → Stop early
- **Medium** (some investment, some risk) → Epic 2 or 3
- **High** (significant resources, hard to undo) → Epic 3, 4, or 5

### Time Available
- **Urgent** (need decision now) → Epic 1 or 2
- **Normal** (days to decide) → Epic 2 or 3
- **Patient** (weeks/months to decide) → All epics available

### Confidence Level
- **High confidence** (know what to do) → Stop early
- **Medium confidence** (directional clarity) → Epic 2 or 3
- **Low confidence** (uncertain, need analysis) → Epic 3+

### Information Needs
- **Quick insight** (pattern recognition) → Epic 1
- **Personalized advice** (tailored recommendation) → Epic 2
- **Systematic comparison** (options, risks, scenarios) → Epic 3
- **Solution design** (wireframes, specs) → Epic 4
- **Execution support** (tracking, blockers, measurement) → Epic 5

## Epic Usage Patterns

### Most Common: Stop at Epic 2
**~70% of decisions** (estimated):
- Pattern recognized
- Discovery uncovers constraints and priorities
- Recommendation is clear
- User feels confident

**Example**: "Should I redesign my office?" → Epic 1 identifies Personal Sanctuary pattern → Epic 2 explores usage and budget → Recommendation clear → User acts

### Common: Use Epic 3 for Complex Decisions
**~20% of decisions** (estimated):
- Multiple viable options exist
- Stakes are high
- User wants systematic comparison
- Risk assessment valuable

**Example**: "Should I join startup or stay at big tech?" → Epic 1-2 gather info → Epic 3 compares options with risks → User chooses confidently

### Rare: Use Epic 4-5 for High-Stakes Implementations
**~10% of decisions** (estimated):
- Building something significant
- Team needs alignment on design
- Want to track progress and measure outcomes
- Learn from implementation

**Example**: "Should I build this SaaS product?" → Epic 1-3 validate and design approach → Epic 4 creates wireframes/specs → Epic 5 tracks build and measures success

## Key Principle: Respect User Time

**Don't force depth**:
- If Epic 2 recommendation is clear and user confident → Don't push for Epic 3
- If user wants quick insight → Don't force full discovery
- If stakes are low → Don't require deep analysis

**Match effort to value**:
- Small decisions don't need big processes
- Complex decisions deserve thorough exploration
- User decides what's proportional

**Trust user judgment**:
- Users know their constraints better than system
- Users know their confidence level
- Users decide when they have enough
