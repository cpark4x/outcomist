# Test Results

**Purpose**: Version-specific outputs for all test scenarios

This folder contains the actual responses generated by different versions of Outcomist for each test scenario defined in [test-scenarios.md](../test-scenarios.md).

---

## Structure

Each test result file follows the naming convention:
```
test-[ID]-results-v[VERSION].md
```

**Example**:
- `test-12-results-v4.5.md` - Johanna's diving test run with v4.5
- `test-12-results-v4.6.md` - Johanna's diving test run with v4.6 (expected improvement)

---

## File Contents

Each result file should include:

### Header
```markdown
# Test #[ID] Results - v[VERSION]

**Test**: [Test Name]
**Version**: v[VERSION]
**Date Tested**: YYYY-MM-DD
**Tester**: [Name or Anonymous]
**Score**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (1-5 stars)
```

## Using These Results

### For Regression Testing
1. Read the decision statement from [test-scenarios.md](../test-scenarios.md)
2. Run `/explore [decision statement]` with current version
3. Compare output to previous version results in this folder
4. Document new results in a new file

### For Version Comparison
Compare same test across versions:
- `test-12-results-v4.5.md` - Failed (factual error, missed trade-off)
- `test-12-results-v4.6.md` - Should fix (trade-off presentation)

### For Validation Reports
Aggregate results across all tests for a version:
- See `../v4.5-validation-report.md` for example
- See `../v4.6-implementation-plan.md` for testing strategy

## Current Status

**v4.5 Results Documented**:
- Test #1: Health Decision ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
- Test #6: Workplace Politics ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
- Test #9: Ken's Workspaces ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
- Test #10: Chris's Novelty Question ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
- Test #11: Manoj's Infrastructure Agent ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

**v4.5 Failures**:
- Test #12: Johanna's Diving ⭐⭐ (factual error + missed trade-off)
- Test #13: Similarity Question ⭐ (wrong approach)

**v4.6 Testing Needed**:
- Test #12 retest (should fix failures)
- Test #9 retest (validate enhancement)
- Test #14 retest (validate trade-off on success case)
- New scenarios (fresh validation)

---

**Next Steps**:
1. Extract v4.5 results from validation report into individual files
2. Document Test #12 and #13 v4.5 failures
3. Run v4.6 tests and document results
4. Create v4.6-validation-report.md aggregating all v4.6 results
