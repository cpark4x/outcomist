## Risk Mitigation Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (Pre-Ship) - ✅ COMPLETED

1. **Manual Validation** - ✅ COMPLETE - Tests #12, #14, #15 validated manually
   - Test #12 (Johanna's Diving): ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ PASS - Trade-off discovery working perfectly
   - Test #14 (Wrong Question): ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ PASS - Reframe timing excellent (Round 1)
   - Test #15 (Children's Nutrition): ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ PASS - Execution flow routing correctly

2. **Timing Check** - ✅ VALIDATED - Test #14 reframe happened immediately in Round 1 (better than predicted)
3. **Flow Validation** - ✅ VALIDATED - Both trade-off discovery (#12) and execution request (#15) boundaries clear

### Post-Ship Monitoring (First 2 Weeks)

1. **User Feedback Collection** - Watch for:
   - "Took too long to get to the point" (reframe delay)
   - "Confused about what this tool does" (reduced ceremony backfire)
   - "Felt too casual/informal" (tone mismatch)

2. **Metrics to Track**:
   - Completion rate (does reduced ceremony improve?)
   - Time to first insight (should be faster)
   - User satisfaction with tone (should improve)

3. **A/B Test Candidates** (if needed):
   - Inline time expectations vs prominent box (scannability)
   - Immediate answering vs optional "ready?" gate (commitment)
   - Conversational phrasing vs directive questions (tone preference)
