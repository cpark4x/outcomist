### Test #4: Cancer Prevention ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
**Source**: `archive/test-logs/TEST_LOG_NOV3_CANCER_PREVENTION.md`
**Pattern**: #3 Health Anxiety
**Decision**: "i want to make sure i prevent cancer. i feel like preventitive is the best option. what should i do"

**Key Context**:
- Friend got stage 4 cancer (trigger)
- Age 46, dad died at 53
- Family history: stomach + colon cancer (hereditary pattern flag)
- Currently doing "standard screenings" (gap for high-risk individual)

**Recommendation**: Risk-Stratified Screening Plan (not generic prevention)
- Genetic counseling within 2 weeks
- Gather family medical details
- Risk-stratified screening schedule (may need colonoscopy every 3-5 years, not 10)

**Breakthrough**: Q3 - Specific cancer types (stomach + colon) revealed hereditary pattern

**User Feedback**: "okay, this was another successful test"

### Test #5: Feature Decision ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
**Source**: `archive/test-logs/TEST_LOG_NOV4_FEATURE_DECISION.md`
**Pattern**: #5 Popularity Contest Hiding Identity Crisis
**Decision**: "10 customers want Feature X (workplace presence tracking), 2 customers want Feature Y (exclude list for safety)"

**Key Context**:
- Product positioning: "Employees first"
- Feature X = RTO enforcement tool (serves employers, surveillance)
- Feature Y = Safety feature (serves employees, privacy)
- Can't build both without contradiction

**Recommendation**: Build Feature Y, Pause Feature X, Clarify Product Identity
- Feature X contradicts stated values
- 2 customers with safety needs > 10 customers wanting surveillance
- Identity crisis: Can't serve both employers and employees

**Breakthrough**: Q3 - Product positioning question revealed values contradiction

**User Feedback**: "okay, thanks"

### Test #8: Meal Planning App ⭐⭐⭐⭐
**Source**: `archive/test-logs/TEST_LOG_NOV4_MEAL_PLANNING_APP.md`
**Pattern**: #7 Solution Looking for Problem
**Decision**: User wants to build comprehensive meal planning app

**Key Context**:
- First-time builder
- 5-10 hrs/week availability
- Comprehensive feature list (custom plans, recipes, shopping lists, nutrition tracking)
- Couldn't answer "What's the ONE problem frustrating you most?"

**Recommendation**: Validate Problem First, Then Build Narrow MVP
- Build one feature well, not all features poorly
- Start with problem validation, not feature building
- 5-10 hrs/week + comprehensive scope = will never ship

**Breakthrough**: Q4 - Couldn't articulate core pain point (revealed solution-first thinking)

**User Feedback**: Implied acceptance (test logs show successful pattern recognition)

**Note**: These early version tests (pre-v4.4) validated core patterns that evolved into v4.5/v4.6 features:
- Pattern recognition (all tests)
- One-by-one questioning (all tests)
- Adaptive recommendations (Tests #3, #7)
- Financial reality checks (Tests #3, #7)
