## Test Results Detail

### Test #12: Johanna's Diving Vacation (Trade-off Scenario)
**Status**: ✅ PASS

**What We Tested**:
- Trade-off discovery mechanism (v4.6)
- Decision question handling
- Executable proposal delivery
- Epic 1 → Epic 2 transition

**User Decision Statement**:
> Johanna wants to plan her next scuba diving vacation ideally in the Caribbean. She is a seasoned scuba diver and is itching to go on her next trip. Help her choose.

**Key Interactions**:
1. Discovery questions asked:
   - What marine life do you want to see? → "whales"
   - When can you travel? → "dec ideal, but jan okay"
   - Budget and travel style? → "$5-7k, traveling with husband, likes structured dives"

2. Trade-off presented (correct conflict detection):
   - **Option A**: December departure (preferred timing but pre-whale season)
   - **Option B**: January-March departure (peak whale season but off preferred timing)

3. User chose: "B" (whale encounters over December timing - revealed preference)

4. Executable proposal delivered:
   - Specific destination: Dominica
   - Specific dive operators with pricing
   - Budget breakdown
   - Timing recommendations for peak whale encounters
   - Booking timeline

**What Worked**:
- ✅ Trade-off discovery correctly identified timing vs. whale season conflict
- ✅ WebSearch verified Caribbean whale seasons (factual validation)

**What Worked**:
- ✅ v4.7 question type detection working correctly
- ✅ Immediate research (improved bedside manner vs. v4.5)
- ✅ Clear comparison structure
- ✅ No unnecessary discovery mode

**What Worked**:
- ✅ v4.7 execution request detection working
- ✅ Minimal discovery questions (3 scoping only)

## UX Improvements Identified

### 1. Numbered Lists for Scannability 📝
**From**: Test #13 user feedback
**Issue**: Lists presented with bullet points instead of numbers
**User Request**: "feedback. i wish the options were numbered. 1."
**Fix**: Add numbered formatting to lists in information request responses and option presentations
**Priority**: High (directly requested by user)
**Status**: Pending implementation
