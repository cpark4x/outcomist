## Key Findings

### ✅ Major Improvements (v4.6 → v4.7)

**1. Question Type Detection (NEW in v4.7)**
- **What changed**: Step 0 now routes Information/Execution/Decision requests appropriately
- **Impact**: Fixes Test #13 (similarity question) and Test #15 (nutrition meals)
- **Evidence**:
  - Information requests get immediate research (no unnecessary discovery)
  - Execution requests get practical output (no premise-questioning)
  - Eliminates "bedside manner" friction identified in user feedback

**2. Trade-Off Discovery Mechanism (v4.6)**
- **What changed**: After Round 1, surfaces conflicting dimensions as explicit choice
- **Impact**: Fixes Test #12 (diving vacation trade-off)
- **Evidence**:
  - Template includes factual validation requirement ("RESEARCH FIRST")
  - Presents Option A vs Option B with explicit pros/cons
  - Uses revealed preference (choices > stated preferences)

**3. Factual Validation Requirement (v4.6)**
- **What changed**: "CRITICAL: If presenting trade-off options requires factual claims, RESEARCH FIRST"
- **Impact**: Prevents Test #12 type failures (incorrect whale season dates)
- **Risk**: Depends on execution - prompt guidance only

### ⚠️ Potential Risks

**1. Question Type Detection Errors**
- **Risk**: Misclassifying ambiguous requests
- **Mitigation**: "If ambiguous: Default to DECISION type (preserves current behavior)"
- **Concern**: Defaults might not always be correct

**2. Trade-Off Detection Failure**
- **Risk**: Missing conflicts that exist but aren't obvious
- **Example**: Test #12 only works if Round 1 reveals "December + whales" conflict
- **Concern**: Relies on AI judgment to detect conflicts

**3. Factual Validation Execution**
- **Risk**: Prompt says "RESEARCH FIRST" but doesn't enforce it
- **Concern**: Could still present wrong facts if AI skips research
- **Impact**: Would repeat Test #12 type failures

## Test-by-Test Analysis

### Test #1: Health Decision ✅

**Scenario**: "Which health option should I choose - gym, nutritionist, or home workout?"

**Expected Pattern**: Repeated failure pattern (all three tried before, all failed)

**v4.7 Assessment**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

**Analysis**:
- Question type: "Which option should I choose?" → **DECISION** (correct routing)
- Tier 1 reframe: "What's making health efforts stick vs. fail?" (addresses root cause)
- Dimensions shown:
  1. Past attempts - where it broke down
  2. Current lifestyle - schedule, constraints, energy
  3. Success conditions - what needs to be true to stick
  4. Underlying goal - what's the real optimization

**Strengths**:
- Correctly identifies this as prioritization decision needing discovery
- Pattern recognition prompt guides toward failure pattern
- Questions framework naturally surfaces past attempts (dimension 1)

**Verdict**: Would maintain v4.5 performance ✅

---

### Test #6: Workplace Politics ✅

**Scenario**: "Should I confront colleague or tell manager about credit stealing?"

**Expected Pattern**: Surface=confront vs escalate, Real=is this one person or systemic visibility?

**v4.7 Assessment**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

**Analysis**:
- Question type: "Should I...?" → **DECISION** (correct routing)
- Tier 1 reframe opportunity: "Is this one person or structural problem?"
- Execution decision framework provides relevant dimensions:
  - Scope (one incident or pattern?)
  - Constraints (political dynamics)
  - Capabilities (relationship management skills)

**Strengths**:
- Correctly routes to decision flow
- Execution decision guidance fits workplace scenario
- Summary step before recommendation prevents premature judgment

**Verdict**: Would maintain v4.5 performance ✅

---

### Test #9: Ken's Workspaces ✅

**Scenario**: "Build /design and /build now, or validate /explore first?"

**Expected Pattern**: Vision ambition vs. validation discipline

**v4.7 Assessment**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

**Analysis**:
- Question type: "Should I build X or validate Y?" → **DECISION** (correct routing)
- Prioritization decision framework applies:
  - Current pain points (what's broken with /explore)
  - Options on radar (/design, /build concepts)
  - Capacity and timeline (realistic assessment)
  - Success metrics (what matters)

**Strengths**:
- Collaborative partnership tone maintained ("Help me understand...")
- Evidence gathering emphasis ("Show me" questions for demos/prototypes)
- Context inference guidelines prevent assuming founder/stage
- Co-creation offer at end fits Ken's collaborative style

**Verdict**: Would maintain v4.5 performance ✅

---

### Test #10: Novelty Question ✅ (IMPROVED)

**Scenario**: "Is Outcomist novel? Salil asked if this isn't simply an agent."

**Expected Challenge**: Information request, not decision. Needs competitive depth.

**v4.5 Failure**: ⭐⭐⭐ (shallow competitive analysis, user asked "what does accommodating mean?")

**v4.7 Assessment**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

**Analysis**:
- Question type: "Is X similar to Y?" → **INFORMATION REQUEST** (correct routing) ✅
- Flow:
  1. Acknowledge: "Let me research that for you..."
  2. WebSearch immediately (no meta-questions)
  3. Deliver comprehensive findings with HOW/WHY depth
  4. Optional follow-up: "Does this answer it, or is there a decision here?"

**Improvements from v4.5**:
- ✅ No longer asks "What's your experience using ChatGPT for decisions?" (wrong approach)
- ✅ Immediate research instead of discovery mode
- ✅ Competitive analysis template includes HOW/WHY explanations
- ✅ Examples show strength/limitation breakdown

**Example competitive template** (lines 803-846):
```
**[Tool] works within your framing:**
- You ask: "[Example question]"
- It responds: "[How it responds]"
- Strength: [What it does well]
- Limitation: [Where it fails and WHY]
```

**Verdict**: v4.7 would FIX v4.5 failure ✅

---

### Test #11: Infrastructure Agent ✅

**Scenario**: "Build autonomous infra agent for deployment and management"

**Expected Challenge**: Don't assume founder/product/stage. Ask about role/goal.

**v4.5 Lesson**: Made assumptions → prescriptive tone → user felt unheard

**v4.7 Assessment**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

**Analysis**:
- Question type: "I want to build..." → Could be **DECISION** or **EXECUTION**
- If detected as DECISION: Goes to Tier 1 pattern recognition
- Context inference guidelines (lines 687-742):
  - ❌ "Don't assume role/stage without evidence"
  - ❌ "Don't give prescriptive roadmaps without confidence in context"
  - ❌ "Don't say 'product-killing trap' or similar judgmental language"
  - ✅ "Partnership language: 'you know your context better than I do'"

**Strengths**:
- Explicit guidance on what NOT to assume
- Three context-handling options if missing:
  - Option A: Ask explicitly before recommending
  - Option B: Caveat recommendation with assumptions
  - Option C: Provide multiple paths based on context
- Stress-test framing prevents prescription

**Verdict**: Would maintain v4.5 improvements ✅

---

### Test #12: Diving Vacation ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (IMPROVED - NEEDS REAL-WORLD TEST)

**Scenario**: "Plan scuba vacation in Caribbean. December ideal. Seeing whale would be epic."

**Expected Challenge**: Hidden trade-off between December timing and peak whale season

**v4.5 Failure**: ⭐⭐
- Made factual error about whale seasons
- Missed trade-off between dates and whale odds
- Assumed December was hard constraint

**v4.7 Assessment**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (would likely fix, but needs validation)

**Analysis**:
- Question type: "Help her choose" → **DECISION** (correct routing)
- Trade-off discovery triggers (lines 473-478):
  - ✅ "User stated preferences that contradict each other"
  - ✅ "Timeline preference vs. optimal conditions (dates vs. quality)"
- Factual validation (lines 489-493):
  - ✅ "CRITICAL: If presenting trade-off options requires factual claims, RESEARCH FIRST"
  - ✅ "Example: Whale season dates..."
  - ✅ "Don't present options based on assumptions"

**Expected Flow**:
1. Round 1: "Help me understand priorities - what matters most?"
2. User answers: "December ideal, seeing whale would be epic"
3. **Conflict detected**: December dates + whale encounters
4. **WebSearch**: Research actual whale seasons at Caribbean dive sites
5. **Trade-off presentation**:
   ```
   ## I see a trade-off between timing and whale encounters:

   **Option A: December trip (your preferred timing)**
   - Pro: You go when you want
   - Con: Whale encounter odds ~[X]% (research-backed number)
   - Impact: Prioritizes schedule over wildlife

   **Option B: [Peak season months] trip**
   - Pro: Whale encounter odds ~[Y]% (research-backed)
   - Con: Shifts dates by [timeframe]
   - Impact: Prioritizes wildlife over schedule

   Which matters more - keeping December dates, or maximizing whale encounters?
   ```
6. User's choice reveals actual priority
7. Recommendation based on revealed preference

**Strengths**:
- Trade-off mechanism directly addresses Test #12 failure mode
- Factual validation requirement prevents wrong statistics
- Revealed preference over assumed constraints

**Risks**:
- Depends on AI detecting conflict after Round 1
- Depends on AI actually performing research (not just prompted to)
- Factual claims still possible if research skipped

**Verdict**: Prompt design would FIX v4.5 failure, but needs real-world test to confirm ⚠️

---

### Test #13: Similarity Question ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (IMPROVED - NEEDS REAL-WORLD TEST)

**Scenario**: "Is Outcomist similar to ChatGPT?"

**Expected Challenge**: Information request, not decision. Don't make user do research.

**v4.5 Failure**: ⭐
- Went into discovery mode ("What's your experience using ChatGPT?")
- Made user do the work instead of providing answer
- User feedback: "Shouldn't you research for me?"

**v4.7 Assessment**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (would fix, but needs validation)

**Analysis**:
- Question type: "Is X similar to Y?" → **INFORMATION REQUEST** (correct routing) ✅
- Information Request Flow (lines 88-115):
  1. Acknowledge: "Let me research that for you..."
  2. WebSearch immediately (no meta-questions) ✅
  3. Deliver comprehensive findings
  4. Optional follow-up: "Does this answer it, or is there a decision here?"

**Expected Flow**:
1. Detect: "Is Outcomist similar to ChatGPT?" = Information request
2. Acknowledge: "Let me research that for you..."
3. WebSearch: Research ChatGPT's decision-making approach
4. Deliver: Explain HOW they're different (with examples)
5. Optional: "Does this answer your question, or are you trying to decide something?"

**Strengths**:
- ✅ No discovery questions about user's experience
- ✅ Immediate research (value-first approach)
- ✅ "No gates, no meta-questions" principle
- ✅ Competitive analysis template provides depth

**Risks**:
- Depends on accurate question type classification
- "Is X similar to Y?" must reliably trigger information flow
- If misclassified as decision, would repeat v4.5 failure

**Verdict**: Prompt design would FIX v4.5 failure, but needs real-world test to confirm ⚠️

---

### Test #14: Wrong Question Prioritization ✅

**Scenario**: "Build Feature X for 10 customers or Feature Y for 2 customers? ($50K ARR at risk if Y not built)"

**Expected Pattern**: Surface=10 vs 2 (volume), Real=retention crisis

**v4.7 Assessment**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

**Analysis**:
- Question type: "Should I build X or Y?" → **DECISION** (correct routing)
- Prioritization framework applies with retention-sensitive dimensions
- Trade-off discovery would surface (lines 535-552):
  ```
  ## I see a trade-off between volume and retention:

  **Option A: Build Feature X for 10 customers**
  - Pro: Serves more customers (volume signal)
  - Con: $50K ARR remains at risk, retention issue unresolved
  - Impact: Prioritizes growth signal over retention

  **Option B: Build Feature Y for 2 customers ($50K ARR at risk)**
  - Pro: Protects existing revenue, addresses retention crisis
  - Con: Serves fewer customers
  - Impact: Prioritizes retention over volume
  ```

**Strengths**:
- Pattern recognition would identify retention crisis (not just volume comparison)
- Trade-off presentation makes retention risk EXPLICIT
- Would exceed v4.5 performance by making trade-off even clearer

**Verdict**: Would maintain/exceed v4.5 performance ✅

---

### Test #15: Children's Nutrition ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (IMPROVED - NEEDS REAL-WORLD TEST)

**Scenario**: "Figure out what foods and meals to feed kids to maximize growth. Doctor recommended dietary changes."

**Expected Challenge**: Execution request (wants meal ideas), not decision question

**v4.6 Failure**: ⭐⭐ (pattern recognition felt condescending, too much discovery, user wanted meal ideas faster)

**User Feedback**: "We wanted to explore different meal ideas and spent a lot of time to get here"

**v4.7 Assessment**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (would fix, but needs validation)

**Analysis**:
- Question type: "Figure out what foods and meals..." → **EXECUTION REQUEST** (correct routing) ✅
- Execution Request Flow (lines 118-158):
  1. Acknowledge goal: "I'll help you create meals that maximize growth."
  2. Gather practical constraints (minimal, focused):
     - Dietary restrictions?
     - Food preferences?
     - Time/budget limitations?
  3. Deliver practical output (meal list)
  4. Optional follow-up: "Want help with next steps?"

**Expected Flow**:
1. Detect: "What foods and meals..." = Execution request
2. Acknowledge: "I'll help you create meals that maximize growth."
3. Ask constraints: "Any dietary restrictions? Food preferences? Time/budget limits?"
4. User: "Mason no dairy, Charlotte eats everything, doctor said more fats/food"
5. **Deliver meal ideas immediately**:
   - Breakfast: [specific meals]
   - Lunch: [specific meals]
   - Dinner: [specific meals]
   - Snacks: [specific meals]
6. Follow-up: "Want help creating a weekly meal rotation?"

**Improvements from v4.6**:
- ✅ No premise-questioning ("Is Charlotte's size a problem?")
- ✅ Minimal discovery (constraints only)
- ✅ Fast path to practical output
- ✅ Respects that user has doctor's advice and wants to execute it

**When NOT to challenge premise** (lines 153-156):
- ✅ User has expert advice (doctor recommendation)
- ✅ No safety concern
- ✅ Not obviously contradictory

**Risks**:
- Depends on accurate question type detection
- "Figure out what foods..." must trigger execution flow
- If misclassified as decision, would repeat v4.6 failure

**Verdict**: Prompt design would FIX v4.6 failure, but needs real-world test to confirm ⚠️

---

### Test #16: Progesterone and Acne ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (IMPROVED)

**Scenario**: "Laura taking 100mg progesterone. Helped with sleep/hair/mood. But still has bad acne breakouts. Why is this happening?"

**Expected Challenge**: Information request - "Why is X happening?" needs immediate research

**v4.6 Result**: ⭐⭐⭐ (delivered research, but lost on bedside manner due to unnecessary friction)

**User Feedback**: "ChatGPT has better bedside manner. Same outcome but smoother."

**v4.7 Assessment**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (improved bedside manner)

**Analysis**:
- Question type: "Why is X happening?" → **INFORMATION REQUEST** (correct routing) ✅
- Information Request Flow eliminates friction:
  1. Acknowledge: "Let me research that for you..."
  2. WebSearch immediately (no meta-questions) ✅
  3. Deliver comprehensive findings
  4. Optional: "Does this answer it, or is there a decision here?"

**Expected Flow**:
1. Detect: "Why is X happening?" = Information request
2. **NO meta-questions** ("Is this decision or information?") ✅
3. Acknowledge + Research immediately
4. Deliver findings about progesterone/acne mechanisms
5. Optional: Offer decision help if there's treatment choice to make

**Improvements from v4.6**:
- ✅ Removes friction (no "What type of help do you need?" question)
- ✅ ChatGPT-level bedside manner (jump straight to value)
- ✅ Same outcome, smoother path

**Verdict**: v4.7 would IMPROVE v4.6 bedside manner ✅

## Feature Assessment

### v4.6 Features (Trade-Off Discovery)

**1. Trade-Off Detection** ⚠️ **CONDITIONAL**

**Strengths**:
- Clear trigger patterns identified (lines 473-485)
- Explicit format for presenting trade-offs
- Factual validation requirement
- Revealed preference mechanism

**Concerns**:
- **Detection accuracy**: Relies on AI judgment to recognize conflicts
- **Factual validation**: Prompt says "RESEARCH FIRST" but doesn't enforce
- **Trigger sensitivity**: Might miss subtle conflicts or trigger on non-conflicts

**Recommendation**:
- ✅ Ship the feature (prompt design is sound)
- ⚠️ Monitor first 10 real-world uses closely
- ⚠️ Add explicit examples of conflicts that should/shouldn't trigger

**2. Revealed Preference Mechanism** ✅ **READY**

**Strengths**:
- Sound psychological principle (choices > statements)
- Clear guidance on using choice to guide Round 2
- Appropriate for decision-making context

**Concerns**: None significant

**Recommendation**: ✅ Ship with confidence

---

### v4.7 Features (Question Type Detection)

**1. Information Request Flow** ⚠️ **CONDITIONAL**

**Strengths**:
- Fixes Test #10, #13, #16 failure modes
- "Value first" principle (no gates)
- Clear routing logic

**Concerns**:
- **Classification accuracy**: What if ambiguous requests misrouted?
- **Default fallback**: "If ambiguous, default to DECISION" - is this always right?
- **Edge cases**: "Help me understand if I should do X" = Information or Decision?

**Recommendation**:
- ✅ Ship the feature (addresses real pain points)
- ⚠️ Monitor misclassification rate
- ⚠️ Consider explicit "unsure" state that asks user

**2. Execution Request Flow** ⚠️ **CONDITIONAL**

**Strengths**:
- Fixes Test #15 failure mode (over-discovery on execution requests)
- Respects user intent (wants to execute, not explore)
- Clear safety boundaries (when to challenge premise)

**Concerns**:
- **Classification accuracy**: "What meals..." must reliably trigger execution
- **Premise challenge**: When to question vs. when to help execute
- **Context loss**: Might miss deeper decision beneath execution request

**Recommendation**:
- ✅ Ship the feature (addresses real user friction)
- ⚠️ Monitor for cases where execution should have been decision
- ⚠️ Consider adding "By the way, is there a broader decision here?" at end

---

## Pattern Recognition Accuracy

**Tested Patterns**:
1. ✅ Repeated failure (Test #1) - Framework supports
2. ✅ Surface vs. structural (Test #6) - Framework supports
3. ✅ Vision vs. validation (Test #9) - Framework supports
4. ✅ Retention crisis (Test #14) - Framework supports
5. ⚠️ Hidden trade-offs (Test #12) - Depends on execution

**Pattern Recognition Score**: 9/10

**Strengths**:
- Tier 1 reframe prompts guide toward deeper patterns
- Question frameworks surface relevant dimensions
- Context inference guidelines prevent false patterns

**Weakness**:
- Trade-off detection relies on AI judgment (not foolproof)

---

## Discovery Question Quality

**Evaluated Criteria**:
1. ✅ Relevance to decision context
2. ✅ Progressive depth (Round 1 → Round 2)
3. ✅ Avoid repetition
4. ✅ Surface non-obvious factors

**Question Quality Score**: 9/10

**Strengths**:
- Five decision type frameworks (Existence, Prioritization, Execution, Timing, Audience)
- "Show me" emphasis (request artifacts, not descriptions)
- Capability checking (don't assume limitations)
- Collaborative tone ("Help me understand...")

**Improvement Area**:
- More explicit examples per decision type would help consistency

---

## Collaborative Partnership Tone

**v4.5 Improvements Maintained**:
- ✅ "Let me offer another angle" (not "But the real question is")
- ✅ "This reframe isn't saying your question is wrong"
- ✅ "Help me understand..." (not "Walk me through...")
- ✅ "Stress-test" framing (not prescriptive)
- ✅ Context inference guidelines (don't assume)

**Tone Score**: 10/10

**Assessment**: Collaborative partnership design fully integrated and reinforced throughout prompt.

---

## Recommendations

### SHIP DECISION: ⚠️ **CONDITIONAL SHIP**

**Ship v4.7 IF:**
1. ✅ Accept 10-20% risk of question type misclassification
2. ✅ Commit to monitoring first 50 real-world uses
3. ✅ Have rollback plan to v4.5 if major issues
4. ✅ Document known edge cases

**DON'T ship v4.7 IF:**
1. ❌ Zero tolerance for misclassification errors
2. ❌ No monitoring/feedback system in place
3. ❌ Can't rollback quickly if needed

### Recommended Ship Strategy

**Option A: Phased Rollout** (RECOMMENDED)
1. Ship v4.7 to 10% of users
2. Monitor classification accuracy for 1 week
3. If <5% misclassification rate: Full rollout
4. If 5-15% misclassification: Refine and re-test
5. If >15% misclassification: Rollback to v4.5

**Option B: Confidence-Based Routing**
- High confidence classification → Use v4.7 routing
- Low confidence classification → Default to v4.5 (decision flow)
- Track confidence scores to improve over time

**Option C: Immediate Full Rollout**
- Higher risk, faster learning
- Requires excellent monitoring
- Fast iteration on issues

### Critical Validation Tests

Before full rollout, run these 5 real-world tests:

**1. Information Request Edge Cases**
```
"Should I learn more about X before deciding?"
"Can you help me understand if this is worth it?"
"What should I know about X to make this decision?"
```
**Expected**: Should these be Information or Decision? Validate routing.

**2. Execution Request Edge Cases**
```
"Help me figure out how to approach this decision"
"What should I do to evaluate my options?"
```
**Expected**: Should these be Execution or Decision? Validate routing.

**3. Trade-Off Detection Accuracy**
```
Run Test #12 with real AI responses
Verify: Conflict detected? Research performed? Options accurate?
```

**4. Factual Validation Compliance**
```
Present scenario requiring factual claims
Verify: Did AI actually research before presenting options?
```

**5. Classification Ambiguity**
```
"I want to understand whether I should build X"
"Help me know if this is the right decision"
```
**Expected**: How does v4.7 handle these? Document behavior.

### Post-Ship Monitoring

**Metrics to Track**:
1. **Classification accuracy**: % correctly routed (Information/Execution/Decision)
2. **Trade-off detection rate**: How often triggered in eligible scenarios?
3. **Factual validation compliance**: % of trade-offs that included research
4. **User satisfaction**: Before/after v4.7 (via feedback or ratings)
5. **Session completion rate**: % of users who complete discovery

**Red flags** that would trigger rollback:
- >15% misclassification rate
- Trade-offs triggering on >30% of decisions (too sensitive)
- Trade-offs never triggering (<5% of eligible cases = too insensitive)
- User feedback mentions "wrong type of help" pattern

---

## Conclusion

**v4.7 represents a thoughtful evolution** that directly addresses known failure modes:
- ✅ Test #10, #13 failures (information requests) → Fixed with Information Request Flow
- ✅ Test #15 failure (execution request) → Fixed with Execution Request Flow
- ✅ Test #12 failure (missed trade-off) → Fixed with Trade-Off Discovery
- ✅ Test #16 friction (bedside manner) → Fixed with immediate research

**However, v4.7 introduces new dependencies** on accurate classification and execution:
- ⚠️ Question type detection must be reliable
- ⚠️ Trade-off detection requires good judgment
- ⚠️ Factual validation depends on AI following prompt guidance

**Recommendation**: **CONDITIONAL SHIP** with phased rollout and close monitoring.

**If monitoring shows <5% issues after 50 uses**: Full confidence for v4.7 as production version.

**If monitoring shows 5-15% issues**: Iterate on classification logic and re-test.

**If monitoring shows >15% issues**: Rollback to v4.5 and rethink approach.

---

## Next Steps

1. **Run 5 critical validation tests** (listed above)
2. **Implement monitoring** for classification accuracy and trade-off detection
3. **Prepare rollback procedure** to v4.5 if needed
4. **Ship to 10% of users** for 1 week
5. **Analyze results** and decide on full rollout
6. **Document edge cases** discovered during monitoring
7. **Iterate classification logic** based on real-world feedback

---

**Evaluator**: Claude Code (Coordinator Agent)
**Confidence Level**: 8/10 (high confidence in analysis, moderate confidence in execution)
**Recommended Action**: Phased rollout with monitoring

**Note**: This evaluation is based on prompt analysis. Real-world testing required to validate assumptions about AI behavior, classification accuracy, and trade-off detection reliability.
