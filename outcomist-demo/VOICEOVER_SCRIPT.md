# Outcomist Demo - Voiceover Script

**Status:** ✅ Final version - synchronized with video timing
**Total Duration:** ~2:17 (video sped up 2x from original 4:47)
**Voice:** OpenAI TTS "echo" voice

**Instructions:**
- Script uses `[PAUSE X]` markers for timing synchronization
- Narration synchronized with actual video content through frame analysis
- This script is embedded in `generate_voiceover.py` for automated generation

## Part 1: The Hook (0:00 - 0:30)

**[Screen: Demo intro slide]**

Most people don't know what they **actually want**. [PAUSE] They ask AI for solutions, but is that even the **right problem**?

[PAUSE]

That's why I built Outcomist. [PAUSE] AI that drives **outcomes**, not activities. It helps you figure out what you want **before** taking action.

[PAUSE]

I built this in **three to four days** using Amplifier. Two interfaces, same engine. [PAUSE] Let me show you how it works.

## Part 2: CLI Demo (0:30 - 2:00)

**[Terminal opens]**

The CLI runs through Claude Code. I type slash explore and describe my decision.

**[While typing]**

_[typing sound - no voice]_

**[After typing completes]**

Now watch what happens.

[PAUSE - let conversation flow naturally]

**[As the conversation unfolds, narrate what you're observing]**

See? [PAUSE] Most AI would jump straight to furniture recommendations. But watch what Outcomist is doing...

_[Continue answering questions naturally as they appear]_

[PAUSE]

Look at this. [PAUSE] It's breaking down my thinking... spotting connections I didn't see.

_[Continue the natural Q&A]_

[PAUSE]

It's not giving me answers. [PAUSE] It's helping me **think** differently about the problem.

_[Let conversation reach a natural insight point]_

[PAUSE]

And there it is. [PAUSE] The **real question** underneath. [PAUSE] That's what ChatGPT would have missed.

[PAUSE]

That's the CLI. **Two days** to build.

## Part 3: Web Demo (2:00 - 3:30)

**[Browser opens]**

Now the web version. [PAUSE] Same engine, visual interface.

**[While typing]**

_[typing sound - no voice]_

**[After submitting question]**

Watch this. [PAUSE] It already knows about my family—my wife and daughter. [PAUSE] It's immediately asking about impact on **them**, not just the money.

**[Click profile sidebar]**

See? [PAUSE] It **remembers** who they are, what matters to me. [PAUSE] This isn't generic advice—this is specific to **MY** life.

[PAUSE]

That's the power of memory. [PAUSE] Built in **one to two days**.

## Part 4: How I Built This (3:30 - 4:30)

**[Back to demo slide]**

Here's how: **Amplifier**. [PAUSE] It's a development approach that combines AI with proven patterns.

[PAUSE]

Day one to two: CLI with Claude Code integration. [PAUSE] Working tool in **two days**.

Day three to four: Web UI with Svelte. [PAUSE] Learning as I built. [PAUSE] Full app in **one to two days**.

[PAUSE]

The key? [PAUSE] I orchestrated AI to handle implementation while I focused on the **experience** I wanted to create.

[PAUSE]

Amplifier provides the **patterns**. AI provides the **execution**. I provide the **direction**.

[PAUSE]

The result? [PAUSE] Something that would have taken **weeks** took **days**. [PAUSE] And it works—you just saw it.

[PAUSE]

This is what's possible when you combine clear thinking with the right tools.

[PAUSE]

Link to Amplifier in the description. [PAUSE] Thanks for watching.

## Recording Tips

1. **Warm up your voice** - Read through once before recording
2. **Stand up** - Better breath control and energy
3. **Smile while talking** - Comes through in the audio
4. **Record in 30-second chunks** - Easier to get each section perfect
5. **Leave 3 seconds at start/end** - Makes editing easier
6. **Have water nearby** - Stay hydrated

## Technical Setup

- **Microphone distance**: 6-8 inches from your mouth
- **Room**: Quiet, minimal echo (closet with clothes works great)
- **Software**:
  - Mac: QuickTime Player (File → New Audio Recording)
  - Any platform: Audacity (free)
- **Format**: Export as WAV or M4A (high quality)

## Timing Markers for Video Editing

Use these to sync voiceover to video:

- **0:00** - Demo slide appears
- **0:30** - Terminal opens
- **0:35** - Start typing /explore
- **0:42** - First question appears
- **0:50** - Type answer
- **1:00** - Breakdown appears
- **1:20** - Next question
- **1:28** - Type answer
- **1:35** - Insight appears
- **2:00** - Switch to browser
- **2:05** - Start typing decision
- **2:15** - Response with family context
- **2:25** - Click profile sidebar
- **3:30** - Back to demo slide
- **4:25** - End screen

**Good luck! You've got this. Just be yourself and let your enthusiasm show through.**
