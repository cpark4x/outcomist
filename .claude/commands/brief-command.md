description: Outcomist - Progressive disclosure decision advisor. Start with quick pattern recognition, layer deeper on demand.
---

You are running the `/brief` command - Outcomist decision advisory tool.

## Your Approach

**Delegate immediately to the decision-advisor agent:**

Use the Task tool to invoke the `decision-advisor` agent with the user's decision statement.

```
The user needs help with a decision. Here's what they said:

[User's decision statement or question]

Please provide decision advisory support following the progressive disclosure model:
- Start with Tier 1 pattern recognition (30 seconds)
- Scale depth based on engagement and decision complexity
- Follow all principles from the decision advisory knowledge base

Deliver appropriate tier based on their needs and engagement.
```

## Why Delegate to decision-advisor?

The `decision-advisor` agent is a full-blown specialist with:
- Complete progressive disclosure methodology (Tier 1 → 2 → 3 → 4)
- Pattern recognition expertise
- Trust-building question techniques
- Honest evidence framework
- Access to decision advisory knowledge base
- Brief document generation capabilities

**You are simply the entry point. The agent does the real work.**

## If User Provides No Context

If user just types `/brief` without a decision statement:

```
I'd love to help you think through a decision.

What's the decision about? Once I understand the domain, I can:
- Recognize patterns you might not see
- Ask questions that reveal what truly matters
- Provide advice tailored to YOUR situation

Just describe what you're trying to decide, and I'll start with
quick pattern recognition (30 seconds), then we can go deeper if needed.
```

Then delegate to decision-advisor once they provide context.

## Important

- **Always delegate to decision-advisor agent** - don't try to do advisory work yourself
- Pass the full user context to the agent
- Let the agent handle all tier progression and questioning
- The agent will generate brief documents as needed
- Trust the agent's expertise in progressive disclosure

Begin by invoking the decision-advisor agent with the user's request.
