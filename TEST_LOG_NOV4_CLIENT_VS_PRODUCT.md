# Outcomist Test - Freelance Client vs Product Decision - Nov 4, 2025

**Test Type**: Scenario #11 from test-scenarios.md - Scarcity mindset decision
**Tester**: Chris (user) with Claude Code
**Result**: ✅ PASS - Pattern recognition identified scarcity mindset beneath financial decision

---

## What Was Tested

### Tier 2 Discovery with Scarcity Mindset Reframe
- One-by-one questioning pattern
- 3 questions total (~10 minutes)
- Pattern recognition: "Stable money vs bet on product" → "Fear preventing commitment to opportunity"
- Financial reality-based recommendation (not just ROI calculation)

---

## Test Scenario

**User's Initial Request:**
> "Client wants ongoing work $6K/month (90% of time). Means pausing product for 6+ months. Product has traction (100 users, $2K MRR growing). Stable money or bet on product?"

**Challenge**: This framed as a financial safety vs risk decision, but discovery revealed it was actually a fear-based decision despite strong fundamentals - $60K savings, 12-14 months runway, product growing 4X in 6 months.

---

## How the Session Went

### Tier 1: Pattern Recognition

**Identified pattern:**
- Surface framing: "Stable money ($6K/month client) vs bet on product ($2K MRR)"
- Real question: "Am I choosing safety because I'm afraid to commit to the thing I actually want?"
- The trap: Framing $6K as "stable money" when it's actually $40/hour work (very low rate)
- Signal: "Market is tough" mindset despite strong fundamentals (product 4X growth, 200 paying users, 97% retention)

**User engagement:** Chose "option 2" (5-10 min discovery) - this was using v3.4 before UX fix

### Tier 2: Discovery Questions (One-by-One)

**Question 1: Tell me about this client opportunity - why now? What's driving their urgency?**
- User answer: "it's a relatively new customer. they pitched me with the idea and i think they are looking for cost control. $6k for 35 hours is very light. but the market is really tough and I'm thankful for th ework."
- **KEY INSIGHT**: $6K for 35 hours/week = **$40/hour** (very low freelance rate)
- User framing: "I'm thankful for the work" (scarcity mindset)
- Reality: This is below-market consulting rate
- **Red flag**: "Market is tough" justification when user has strong product traction

**Question 2: Let's talk runway - what's your monthly burn, how much savings do you have, and how long can you afford to say no to $6K? Any financial dependents or obligations that constrain the decision?**
- User answer: "monthly burn is about 5k / 60k in savings / 12-14 months without new income / none / my girlfriend"
- **CRITICAL CONTEXT**: User has **12-14 months runway** with current savings
- Monthly burn: $5K (manageable)
- Savings: $60K (substantial buffer)
- No dependents/obligations constraining decision
- **The scarcity is in the HEAD, not in the bank account**

**Question 3: Product metrics - what was MRR 6 months ago, what's the growth rate, how many paying users, and what's your churn rate?**
- User answer: "MRR was 500k 6 months ago / it is growing about 100 per month / 200 paying 10 per month / 3% chrun"
- **THE FUNDAMENTALS ARE CRUSHING IT**:
  - **MRR growth**: $500 → $2,000 in 6 months = **4X growth**
  - **Growth rate**: $100/month (steady, not slowing down)
  - **Paying users**: 200 users at $10/month
  - **Retention**: 97% (3% churn is excellent)
  - **The product is at an inflection point** - this is when you GO ALL IN, not pause

### Analysis & Recommendation

**Pattern recognized:**
- Surface: "Should I take stable money or bet on risky product?"
- Deeper: "Do I choose safety or growth opportunity?"
- **Deepest**: "Am I letting fear prevent commitment to what I actually want, despite having strong fundamentals?"

**Recommendation delivered**: Say No to Client, Go ALL IN on Product

**Why this recommendation:**

1. **The Math Strongly Favors the Product**
   - Client: $6K/month = $40/hour (below market rate for 35 hours/week)
   - Product: $2K MRR growing $100/month = potential $5K+ MRR in 6 months
   - Compounding: Product revenue compounds, client work is linear
   - Taking client = pausing product at its **inflection point** (4X growth)

2. **You Have 12-14 Months Runway - The Scarcity is in Your Head**
   - $60K savings / $5K burn = **you can afford to bet on yourself**
   - Client only buys 1.2 months of runway ($6K / $5K burn)
   - Product could be $5K+ MRR (covering burn) in 6 months without client
   - **Fear-based decision, not math-based decision**

3. **This Client Opportunity is Actually a RED FLAG**
   - $40/hour is **well below market** for experienced freelancers
   - Client pitched YOU (not the other way around) - suggests desperation
   - "Cost control" framing = they want cheap labor
   - "Market is tough" mindset = operating from scarcity, not opportunity

4. **Your Product is at the Inflection Point - Pausing Now = Death**
   - 4X growth in 6 months = momentum
   - 97% retention = product-market fit
   - 200 paying users = real traction, not experiments
   - Pausing for 6 months = losing momentum, competitors catch up, users churn

**Next actions:**
1. Email client TODAY: "Thank you, but I'm focusing full-time on my product"
2. Audit your spending (this week): Can you reduce $5K/month burn to $4K or $3.5K?
3. Double down on growth (next 3 months): What got you from $500 → $2,000 MRR?
4. Set revenue milestone (90 days): Hit $3K MRR by February 2026
5. Revisit client work ONLY if: Product growth stalls OR runway drops below 6 months

**User validation:** "Great." (test successful)

## What Worked Well

### ✅ Pattern Recognition Through Financial Reality Check

**Evolution of understanding:**
1. Initial: "Stable money vs risky product decision"
2. After Q1: "Client rate is actually very low ($40/hour)"
3. After Q2: "User has 12-14 months runway - no actual scarcity"
4. After Q3: "Product fundamentals are crushing it - fear-based decision"

Each question revealed a deeper layer of the real problem.

### ✅ Financial Reality Over Emotional Framing

**Avoided emotional reasoning:**
- Didn't accept: "Market is tough, I'm thankful for work" as valid constraint
- Did challenge: User has $60K savings, 12-14 months runway - scarcity is in head

**Identified the contradiction:**
- User says: "Market is tough" (scarcity mindset)
- Reality: Product grew 4X in 6 months, 97% retention, 200 paying users
- Math: $40/hour client work vs $100/month MRR growth compounding

### ✅ Reframed Stakes from Safety to Opportunity Cost

**Reframed the question:**
- User framed: "Should I take stable money or risk it all?"
- Real stakes: "Will I let fear kill momentum at the inflection point?"
- Client isn't safety - it's distraction during critical growth phase
- Question isn't "can I afford risk?" - it's "can I afford to pause?"

### ✅ Honest About Scarcity Mindset

**Acknowledged the fear without validating it:**
- "The scarcity is in your head, not your bank account"
- "You're framing this as 'stable money' when it's $40/hour work"
- "$60K savings / $5K burn = 12-14 months - you can afford to bet on yourself"
- Fear is real, but math doesn't support it

## Key Learnings

### 1. Question 1 Revealed Underpriced Client Work

**Before Q1:**
- Seemed like "$6K/month stable income" was attractive offer

**After Q1:**
- $6K for 35 hours/week = **$40/hour** (very low freelance rate)
- Client is "looking for cost control" = wants cheap labor
- User's language: "I'm thankful for the work" = scarcity mindset
- This isn't opportunity - it's desperation on both sides

**The lesson**: When users say "stable money," ask for the hourly rate - might reveal it's actually a bad deal financially.

### 2. Question 2 Revealed False Scarcity

**Before Q2:**
- Thought user might have short runway justifying need for client work

**After Q2:**
- $60K savings / $5K burn = **12-14 months runway**
- No financial dependents or obligations
- Client only buys 1.2 months of runway ($6K once)
- **Scarcity is emotional, not financial**

**The pattern**: "Market is tough" language often signals fear-based decision making, not actual financial constraint.

### 3. Question 3 Revealed Strong Product Fundamentals

**Before Q3:**
- Seemed like product was "growing" but unclear if worth betting on

**After Q3:**
- MRR: $500 → $2,000 in 6 months = **4X growth**
- Growth rate: $100/month (steady, not slowing)
- Retention: 97% (3% churn = excellent)
- 200 paying users = real traction
- **Product is at inflection point - this is GO TIME, not pause time**

**The insight**: User already has product-market fit, now it's about execution and commitment.

### 4. "Stable Money" Often Hides Opportunity Cost

**Client work framing:**
- "Stable money" = sounds safe
- "$6K/month" = sounds like a lot
- "Market is tough" = justifies taking it

**Reality revealed through discovery:**
- $40/hour = below market for experienced freelancers
- Taking it = pausing product at inflection point
- Opportunity cost = potential $5K+ MRR in 6 months (compounding)
- "Stability" is illusion - client work is still finite

**The value**: Question framing that makes bad deals sound attractive through emotional appeals (safety, gratitude, stability).

## What Could Improve

### ⚠️ Could Have Asked About Product Pause Impact Earlier

**Current question flow:**
1. Client opportunity details
2. Financial runway
3. Product metrics

**Better flow:**
1. Product metrics first (understand what's being paused)
2. Client opportunity details (compare rates/value)
3. Financial runway (do you need this?)
4. What happens to product if you pause 6 months? (real cost)

**Why**: Asking about product metrics FIRST would have revealed strong fundamentals immediately, reframing the entire decision from "can I afford risk?" to "can I afford to pause?"

### ⚠️ Didn't Probe "Market is Tough" Mindset Early Enough

**What happened:**
- User said "market is really tough and I'm thankful for the work" in Q1
- But didn't challenge it until recommendation

**Better:**
- When user says "market is tough" in Q1, immediately ask: "What makes you say the market is tough? Your product grew 4X - that suggests the market is working for you."
- This would have surfaced the contradiction during discovery, not just in recommendation

### ⚠️ Could Have Explored Why $40/Hour Rate Was Acceptable

**Missing question:**
- "You're an experienced freelancer with a product at $2K MRR - why is $40/hour acceptable to you?"
- "What's your usual freelance rate? How does $40/hour compare?"
- "Have you considered raising your rate to $80-100/hour if you need short-term income?"

**Why it matters**: Might reveal deeper self-worth or confidence issues beneath the scarcity mindset.

## Comparison to Previous Tests

| Aspect | Office Scenario | Passive Income Scenario | Cancer Prevention Scenario | Feature Decision Scenario | Client vs Product Scenario |
|--------|----------------|------------------------|---------------------------|--------------------------|-----------------------------|
| **Initial framing** | "Redesign office" | "Fast food chain for revenue" | "Cancer prevention" | "10 customers vs 2 customers" | "Stable money vs bet on product" |
| **Real problem** | Personal sanctuary need | Employability anxiety hedge | "Am I doing enough to avoid being blindsided?" | Product identity crisis (surveillance vs safety) | Fear preventing commitment despite strong fundamentals |
| **Discovery insight** | Multi-use space (games + work) | Capital reveal ($500K+) | Hereditary cancer pattern | Feature X = RTO tool, Feature Y = employee safety | Scarcity mindset despite $60K savings, 12-14 months runway, product 4X growth |
| **Recommendation** | Man Cave Refresh | Leverage Capital for Passive Income | Risk-Stratified Screening | Build Feature Y, Pause Feature X, Clarify Strategy | Say No to Client, Go ALL IN on Product |
| **Pivot moment** | Question 4 (usage patterns) | Question 4 (capital amount) | Question 3 (cancer types) | Question 3 (product positioning) | Question 2 (runway reveal) |
| **User validation** | "Captured my core problem well" | "Good outcome!" | "Another successful test" | "okay, thanks" | "Great." |

**Pattern across all tests:** Discovery questions consistently reveal deeper problems beneath surface requests - in this case, a financial decision framed as risk tolerance was actually a fear-based decision despite having strong fundamentals and clear product-market fit.

## New Pattern Captured for Library

**Pattern: "Scarcity Mindset Hiding Opportunity"**

**Surface request:** "Should I take stable money or bet on risky thing?"

**Signals to recognize:**
- Fear-based language ("market is tough," "I'm thankful," "playing it safe")
- Strong fundamentals contradicting scarcity narrative (runway, growth, retention)
- Underpriced "stable" option (below-market rates framed as opportunity)
- Inflection point timing (growth momentum that would be lost if paused)
- Framing choice as "safety vs risk" when math shows risk is minimal

**Real problem:** Fear preventing commitment to opportunity despite having resources and validation

**Key questions to ask:**
1. What's your actual financial runway? (reveal false scarcity)
2. What are the fundamentals of what you're "risking"? (reveal strength)
3. What's the hourly rate of the "stable" option? (reveal if actually underpriced)
4. What happens if you pause momentum? (reveal opportunity cost)

**Common pitfalls:**
- Accepting "market is tough" without challenging with user's own metrics
- Validating fear-based decision when fundamentals are strong
- Treating "stable money" as inherently better than "risky growth"
- Missing that low-rate client work can be a distraction from inflection point

**Example scenarios:** Freelance client vs product decision (this test), job offer leaving startup before exit, taking contract work while business is scaling
