      "content": "The pattern I'm seeing is a \"locked rate optimization trap\" - you're framing this around your 2.4% rate advantage, but your real decision is about **family lifestyle timing versus financial positioning**. You're caught between \"we wish we had more space\" (present need) and \"houses seem cheaper\" (market timing).\n\nHere's what's fascinating: most people focus on rates and prices, but miss the hidden costs of timing mismatches. There are actually three different financial scenarios playing out simultaneously in your situation, and the \"right\" choice depends on which one you're unconsciously prioritizing.\n\nBefore we dig deeper, let me understand your intent:\n\n**Are you looking for validation on WHETHER to pursue this, or guidance on HOW to execute it well?**\n\n[IF VALIDATION SEEKER:]\nI'll ask 4-5 questions (~10 min) to understand:\n• Your family's space constraints and timeline pressures\n• Opportunity costs of waiting vs. moving now\n• What you're truly optimizing for beyond the rate\n\n[IF EXECUTION SEEKER:]\nI'll ask 4-5 questions (~10 min) to understand:\n• Your current financial position and buying power\n• Specific market timing and property evaluation factors\n• Risk management strategies for the transition\n\nReady to explore?",
