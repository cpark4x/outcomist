      "content": "**I recommend you move now, but approach it strategically.**\n\nGiven your specific situation, the timing aligns well for a move. Your 2.4% rate is exceptional, but it shouldn't trap you in a home that doesn't meet your family's needs - especially when you have legitimate space constraints (can't park in your garage, can't entertain in your yard, no workout space) and want to change school districts before your 12-year-old starts high school. Since you've observed that houses are cheaper and this isn't an urgent emotional decision but a calculated one, you're positioned to make a smart move.\n\n**Your next actions should be:**\n1. **Quantify the real cost difference** - Calculate your new monthly payment at current rates versus what you'd gain in space and location value\n2. **Research the Skyline district market specifically** - Get recent sale data to confirm your observation about lower prices\n3. **Set a firm budget ceiling** - Determine the maximum monthly payment increase you're comfortable with, factoring in your current $1.9M equity\n4. **Move quickly but selectively** - Start looking now while inventory may be favorable, but don't rush into the wrong house just because rates might rise\n\nThe key insight is that your 2.4% rate has built you substantial equity that can facilitate this move, and waiting could mean starting high school in the wrong district or facing higher home prices later. Since this isn't a \"must-do\" situation, you can afford to be strategic and walk away if the numbers don't work.",
