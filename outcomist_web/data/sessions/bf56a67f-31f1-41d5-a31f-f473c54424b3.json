      "content": "**I recommend you proceed with this move, but act quickly and strategically.**\n\nYour situation strongly favors moving now. You have compelling reasons beyond just wanting more space - you're unhappy with your current school district and want your 12-year-old in Skyline High School, which creates a natural deadline. The 4-year window before your oldest graduates gives you meaningful time to benefit from this move. The Sammamish home addresses all your specific pain points: much larger backyard, 3-car garage, and space for indoor workouts.\n\nYes, you'll lose your exceptional 2.4% rate and face significantly higher monthly payments at current rates (likely $2,000-3,000+ more monthly), plus substantial transaction costs. However, you're in a strong financial position with significant equity, and your dissatisfaction with your current situation suggests the quality-of-life benefits outweigh the financial costs.\n\n**Next actions:**\n- Get pre-approved immediately at current rates to understand your exact payment and confirm affordability\n- Calculate total transaction costs (selling + buying) \n- Consider keeping your current home as a rental if the numbers work - preserving that 2.4% rate while building wealth\n- Move fast on any Sammamish properties you like, as inventory in good school districts tends to move quickly\n\nThe timing pressure from the school year start makes this decision clearer - if you're going to do it, do it now rather than wait another year with continued unhappiness.",
