      "content": "Based on your specific situation, **I recommend you should buy the larger home now**, and here's why this makes sense for you:\n\nYour timing aligns well on multiple fronts. Your children at 8 and 12 are entering their most space-intensive years - they'll need separate rooms, study areas, and places for friends and activities. The space constraints you're experiencing (no garage parking, no driveway, no yard, storage issues) will only become more challenging as they grow. You're also seeing what you perceive as better home values in the $1.9-2.2M range, which addresses your desire for more space at a reasonable price point.\n\nMost importantly, your locked-in 2.4% rate is a significant financial advantage. Even if your monthly payment increases from the current $4,000, you're securing that low rate on a larger loan amount - something that would be impossible to replicate in today's rate environment. The functional improvements (garage parking, driveway, yard space) will provide daily quality-of-life benefits that compound over time.\n\n**Next steps:** Focus your search on homes that solve your specific space problems - prioritize properties with functional garages, driveways, and outdoor space over other amenities. Run the actual numbers on your target price range to confirm the monthly payment increase fits your budget comfortably, and move decisively when you find the right property since you have both the financial advantage of your rate and the market conditions you believe favor buyers.\n\nThe combination of your family's growing space needs and your exceptional financing position creates a compelling case to act now.",
