      "content": "**TIER 1 PATTERN RECOGNITION**\n\nThis isn't really about \"should I buy\" - you already know you want more space for your growing kids. The real pattern here is timing anxiety: you're weighing a guaranteed financial advantage (that 2.4% rate) against an uncertain market opportunity (cheaper houses) while your family's space needs are becoming urgent.\n\nYou're caught between financial optimization and family optimization. There's actually a hidden third factor most people miss in situations like yours that could completely change how you evaluate this decision. The interplay between your locked rate, market timing, and your kids' developmental stages creates some non-obvious scenarios worth exploring.\n\nBefore we dig deeper, let me understand your intent:\n\n**Are you looking for validation on WHETHER to pursue this, or guidance on HOW to execute it well?**\n\n[IF VALIDATION SEEKER:]\nI'll ask 4-5 questions (~10 min) to understand:\n• Your financial constraints and opportunity costs\n• Risk tolerance given market uncertainty\n• What you're truly optimizing for beyond space\n\n[IF EXECUTION SEEKER:]\nI'll ask 4-5 questions (~10 min) to understand:\n• Your timeline and market strategy\n• Financing logistics with your current rate\n• Success criteria for the right home\n\nReady to explore?",
