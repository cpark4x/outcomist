# Test Log: Amplifier SLT Presentation (Premature Presentation Pattern)

**Date**: 2025-11-04
**Scenario**: Preparing presentation for Satya review on Amplifier project
**Tester**: User (real scenario)
**Version**: v4.0 (`/explore` command)

---

## Initial Request

> i want to work on a presentation for our upcoming Satya review to introduce our Amplifier project t our SLT. I want to make sure that the SLT is aware and bought in on this project. can you look at the github repo for this projects (microsoft amplifier) to help me prepare. the output should be a presentation

**Domain**: Workplace/Management
**Framing**: Presentation preparation request

---

## Tier 1: Pattern Recognition (30 seconds)

**Response:**

> You're framing this as "I need to prepare a presentation about Amplifier for SLT" - but that's not the real decision.
>
> The real question is: **"How do I get buy-in from leadership on something they don't understand yet?"**
>
> You're asking me to look at the GitHub repo and create a presentation - but **presentations don't get buy-in, understanding does.** The fact that you need to "make sure SLT is aware" suggests they don't know this exists yet, which means you're not just presenting progress, you're **pitching for approval on something already in motion.**
>
> That's a very different challenge than "help me make slides."
>
> **Want me to dig deeper? I'll ask 4-5 questions (~10 min) to understand:**
> • What does SLT currently know (or not know) about Amplifier?
> • What decision are you asking them to make? (Approve resources? Give air cover? Just awareness?)
> • What's the risk if they say no or don't understand it?
> • Who on the SLT is your champion vs skeptic?
>
> **Ready to explore?**
>
> (If you already know your presentation strategy and just need execution help, tell me your approach and I can validate it or jump straight to helping you build it)

**User response**: "yes"

## Tier 2: Discovery (5-10 minutes)

### Round 1: High-Level Questions

**Q1: What does SLT currently know (or not know) about Amplifier?**

**Answer**: "assume they know nothing or very little. they do have some context of the project (satya, kevin scott) but most do not. they agree that this approach to building with AI is better. there is a subtle, vibe coding doesn't produce effective results, feeling from many naysayers"

**Insight**:
- Top-level awareness (Satya, Kevin Scott) but middle skepticism
- "Vibe coding doesn't work" sentiment = people have seen AI coding tools fail
- Classic innovator's dilemma: top believes, middle doubts

---

**Q2: What specific decision are you asking SLT to make in this presentation?**

**Answer**: "awareness and aircover. pivot the teams"

**Insight**: Not just awareness - wants **adoption** (pivot teams to use Amplifier). That's asking for behavior change, not just information sharing.

---

**Q3: What's the current adoption status? How many teams/people are using Amplifier now, and what results are they seeing?**

**Answer**: "only a handful of teams are using it but not much real results."

**🎯 CRITICAL INSIGHT**: User wants to pivot teams to something with no proven results yet. This is the credibility gap.

---

**Quick mention**: "a few tools like /designer"

**Follow-up clarification needed**: Some concrete tools exist, but still no measurable results from them.

---

### Round 2: Targeted Questions

**Q4: What happens if SLT says "show us results first, then we'll consider broader adoption"?**

**Purpose**: Understand if "prove it first" is acceptable or if they need commitment NOW despite lack of proof.

**Answer**: [User mentioned `/designer` tool but didn't directly answer the question]

**Re-asked**: "Is that outcome acceptable to you? Or do you NEED them to commit now to pivoting teams before you have results?"

---

**Q5: What's driving the timing of this Satya review? Why present now instead of waiting 3-6 months to build proof?**

**Answer**: "it's just a chck-in . i'm not sure to be honest"

**🎯 BREAKTHROUGH MOMENT**: User doesn't know what they're asking for. "Just a check-in" + "not sure" = **unclear ask, no specific goal.**

---

**Q6: [Implicit] Are you under threat and need air cover now, or can you afford to wait and build proof first?**

**Answer**: [User said "good" to the recommendation, implying no immediate threat]

---

## Recommendation

### DON'T PRESENT AMPLIFIER AT THIS SATYA REVIEW

**Why:**

**The Math Doesn't Work:**

**What you have:**
- Top-level awareness (Satya/Kevin Scott already know) ✅
- A handful of teams using it ✅
- No measurable results yet ❌
- Middle management skepticism ("vibe coding doesn't work") ❌
- Some concrete tools (like `/designer`) ✅

**What you're considering asking for:**
- "Awareness and air cover" (but Satya already knows)
- "Pivot teams" (but you have no proof it works)
- Or maybe just a check-in? (You're not sure)

**The problem:** You don't have a clear ask, and you don't have proof to back up an adoption push.

---

### What Happens If You Present Now

**Best case:**
- SLT says "interesting, show us results in 6 months"
- You've used your one shot at a Satya review for... a postponement

**Likely case:**
- Skeptics ask "what are the results?"
- You say "we don't have results yet, but..."
- They say "come back when you have proof"
- Now you've **anchored Amplifier as 'unproven'** in their minds

**Worst case:**
- Skeptics kill it: "We've seen AI coding tools fail. Show us this is different."
- You have no data to counter with
- Project gets deprioritized or shut down

---

### The Real Question

This isn't "should I present Amplifier?"

**This is: "Am I trying to get permission to continue, or am I trying to avoid getting shut down?"**

If Satya and Kevin Scott already support it, you don't need SLT permission. What you need is **time and space to prove it works.**

---

## What You Should Do Instead

### Option 1: Skip This Review (Recommended)

**Don't present Amplifier at this Satya review.**

Instead:

1. **Spend the next 3-6 months building proof**
   - Get 3-5 teams actually using Amplifier tools
   - Measure something concrete (velocity, quality, satisfaction)
   - Document wins with specifics (not "it's better" but "Team X shipped Feature Y 40% faster")

2. **THEN present at a future Satya review** when you can say:
   - "5 teams using it, here are the results"
   - "We're ready to scale to 20 teams"
   - "Here's what we need to make that happen"

**Why this works:**
- You present from strength, not weakness
- You have proof to counter skeptics
- Your ask is clear: scale what's working

---

### Option 2: Present, But Reframe the Ask

If you MUST present at this review (politics, timing, whatever):

**Don't ask for team pivots. Ask for patience and air cover.**

**Your narrative:**
- "Satya and Kevin Scott see the potential in AI-amplified development"
- "We're experimenting with a handful of teams"
- "Early signal is promising, but too early for results"
- "**Ask: Give us 6 months to prove it, then we'll come back with adoption plan**"

**This frames it as:**
- Exploration (low risk)
- Top-down endorsed (reduces skeptic power)
- Time-bound (clear checkpoint)

**Not as:**
- Mandate to pivot teams (high risk, no proof)

---

### Unless There's a Threat...

**The one scenario where you SHOULD present now:**

If there's a threat (budget cuts, team reassignment, competing initiatives) and you need **air cover immediately** to survive the next 6 months.

In that case, present with the "ask for time" framing (Option 2 above), not the "pivot teams" framing.

---

## Pattern Identified: Premature Presentation (Presenting Without Proof)

**Surface request**: Help me prepare a presentation for leadership

**Signals to recognize**:
- Excited about vision/project
- **No measurable results yet** to back up the ask
- **Unclear what they're asking for** ("just a check-in, not sure")
- Skeptics already exist in the audience
- Top-level support but middle management doubt
- Wants adoption/behavior change without proof

**Real problem**: Presenting too early out of excitement, not readiness. Will burn credibility on "we might have something" when they could wait and present "we DO have something."

**Key questions to ask**:
1. What does the audience currently know? (reveals awareness vs skepticism)
2. What specific decision are you asking them to make? (reveals if ask is clear)
3. What's the current adoption/results status? (reveals if they have proof)
4. What happens if they say "prove it first"? (reveals if timeline is flexible)
5. **What's driving the timing - why now vs later?** (reveals if it's excitement vs necessity)
6. Are you under threat that requires air cover now? (reveals if there's urgency)

**Common pitfalls**:
- Taking "prepare presentation" request at face value
- Not challenging whether they should present at all
- Missing the credibility gap (big ask, no proof)
- Not questioning unclear ask ("not sure what I want")
- Assuming excitement = readiness to present

**What unlocked it**:
- Q3 revealed no results yet
- Q5 revealed unclear ask ("just a check-in, not sure")
- Combination showed: premature presentation driven by excitement, not strategy

---

## User Validation

**User response**: "good"

**What worked:**
- Pattern recognition reframed from "make slides" to "get buy-in on unproven thing"
- Questions progressively revealed: no results → want adoption → unclear ask → no urgency
- Recommendation was direct: **DON'T present now, build proof first**
- Gave clear alternative path: wait 3-6 months, get results, then present

**What to improve:**
- Could have caught "no clear ask" earlier
- Q4 answer was indirect (user mentioned tools instead of answering), needed re-asking

---

## Question Framework Insights

### New Question Type: Strategic Timing

**When to use**: For presentation/pitch decisions, especially without proof

**Purpose**: Reveal whether timing is driven by excitement vs necessity

**Question**: "What's driving the timing - why present now instead of waiting X months to build proof?"

**What this reveals**:
- If answer is vague ("just a check-in") → Excitement, not strategy
- If answer is specific threat → Real urgency, might need to present
- If answer is "not sure" → Definitely not ready to present

**Example**: This test - "just a check-in, not sure" revealed premature presentation

---

### Adaptive Questioning Pattern

**After Q2 revealed ask includes "pivot teams":**
- Q3 asked about current results (revealed none)
- Q4 asked about acceptable fallback (reveals flexibility)
- Q5 asked about timing driver (revealed unclear urgency)

**The flow**: Ask → Results → Flexibility → Urgency

This worked because it built the case that presenting now was premature.

---

## Learnings

1. **"Not sure" is a red flag** - If user doesn't know what they're asking for, they're not ready to present
2. **Excitement ≠ Readiness** - Enthusiasm about a project doesn't mean it's ready for leadership review
3. **Credibility gaps kill projects** - Presenting without proof anchors project as "unproven" in leadership minds
4. **Top support ≠ Middle buy-in** - Satya/Kevin Scott support doesn't mean SLT will adopt without proof
5. **Sometimes the answer is "don't do it"** - Not every presentation should happen
