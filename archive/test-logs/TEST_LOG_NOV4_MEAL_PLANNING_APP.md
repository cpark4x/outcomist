# Test Log: Meal Planning App (Solution Looking for Problem)

**Date**: 2025-11-04
**Scenario**: Build vs validate decision for meal planning app
**Tester**: Ken (colleague)
**Version**: v4.0 (`/explore` command)

---

## Initial Request

> I want to develop a meal planning app that helps people organize their weekly meals, track nutrition, and simplify grocery shopping. The app will allow users to create custom meal plans, save favorite recipes, and generate shopping lists based on their selected meals.

**Domain**: Product/Business
**Framing**: Feature specification for app idea

---

## Tier 1: Pattern Recognition (30 seconds)

**Response:**

> You're describing a meal planning app with a comprehensive feature set - but that's not what you're actually deciding.
>
> The real question is: "Should I build this idea, or is this just another side project that sounds good on paper but won't get finished?"
>
> You've listed features (custom plans, recipes, shopping lists, nutrition tracking) without mentioning WHO needs this or WHY NOW. That's a pattern I see often: detailed solution before validated problem. You're designing the how before understanding the if.
>
> **Want me to dig deeper? I'll ask 4-5 questions (~10 min) to understand:**
> • What triggered you to think about THIS app RIGHT NOW?
> • Who specifically needs this? (yourself, a specific person, a market segment?)
> • What have you tried building before, and what happened?
> • How much time can you realistically invest in the next 3 months?
>
> **Ready to explore?**
>
> (If you already know this is "the one" and you're committed to shipping, tell me what makes this different from past ideas)

**User response**: "yes, let's explore together"

## Tier 2: Discovery (5-10 minutes)

### Round 1: High-Level Questions

**Q1: What triggered you to think about THIS app RIGHT NOW?**

**Answer**: "I had an idea that came to my head. i thought it woudl be supeer cool and useful. didn't do muchresearch."

**Insight**: Spontaneous idea, no research, excitement-driven

---

**Q2: How many side projects or app ideas have you started in the past 2-3 years, and how many of those actually shipped and got used?**

**Answer**: "this is my first."

**Insight**: First-time builder - no history of unfinished projects, but also no shipping experience yet. This changes the analysis - not a serial starter, but also hasn't experienced the reality of what shipping takes.

---

**Q3: What's your current situation - are you employed full-time, student, between jobs? And how many hours per week can you realistically commit to building this?**

**Answer**: "i'm fully employed but have some extra time in the evenigns to commit to this a few days a week."

**Insight**: Full-time job, evenings a few days/week = realistically 5-10 hours/week, maybe 40-50 hours/month

---

**Round 1 Analysis (30-50 words):**

> Here's what I'm seeing: First-time builder, limited time (5-10 hrs/week), some personal pain point validation, but jumping straight to a feature-complete solution (custom plans, recipes, shopping lists, nutrition tracking). That's a 6-month build for someone with limited hours, and you haven't validated if people will actually use it once built.

---

### Round 2: Targeted Questions

**Q4: Before you write any code, have you talked to anyone who actually struggles with meal planning? Like, do you personally waste time every week figuring out meals and making shopping lists, or is this based on what you think would be useful?**

**Answer**: "i have, but only a handful and mostly from my own personal experience."

**Insight**: Some personal experience with meal planning pain, plus a handful of conversations. Not deep validation, but not pure assumption either.

---

**Q5: What's the ONE problem with meal planning that frustrates you most? Like, if you could magically fix just one thing about your current meal planning process, what would it be?**

**Answer**: "i don't konw, i think i need to rethink this more clearly."

**🎯 BREAKTHROUGH MOMENT**: User couldn't answer the core pain point question. If meal planning truly frustrated them every week, they'd immediately say "I waste 2 hours every Sunday" or "I always forget ingredients" or "I can never hit my protein goals."

**This revealed**: Not solving a validated problem. Building a solution they think SHOULD exist.

---

## Recommendation

### DON'T BUILD THIS YET

**Why:**

**The Math Doesn't Work:**
- First-time builder (no shipping experience)
- 5-10 hours/week → 40-50 hours/month
- Feature-complete app = 200-300+ hours minimum
- **That's 6+ months to ship version 1**

**The Validation:**
- "I think it would be super cool and useful"
- A handful of conversations
- **Can't articulate the core pain point**
- No proven demand

**The Risk:** Spend 6 months building something nobody wants, burn out, and learn "building apps is hard and unrewarding."

---

### What to Do Instead

**Option 1: Validate FIRST, Build Second (Recommended)**

**Week 1-2: Problem Discovery**
- Talk to 10-15 people who meal plan
- Ask: "What's the most frustrating part of meal planning for you?"
- Listen for patterns - do multiple people say the same thing?
- Document their exact words

**Week 3-4: Solution Testing**
- If you find a real pattern, test your solution idea
- Describe your app to people who have the problem
- Ask: "If this existed, would you use it? How much would you pay?"
- Watch for genuine excitement vs polite interest

**If validation fails:** You saved yourself 6 months. Try a different idea.
**If validation succeeds:** Now you know exactly what to build and for whom.

---

**Option 2: Build to Learn (Acknowledgment of Reality)**

If you're honest that this is about **learning to code**, not solving a real problem:

**Then build it, but:**
- Scope way down (just shopping list generator from 5 saved recipes)
- Set a ship deadline: 4 weeks maximum
- Focus on shipping SOMETHING, not building everything
- Accept you might be the only user
- Treat it as coding practice, not a product

**Don't fool yourself** that this is a "real" product if you're really just learning to build apps. That's fine! Just be honest about the goal.

---

### The Real Decision

This isn't "Should I build a meal planning app?"

**This is: "Do I want to learn how to validate ideas before building, or do I want to learn by spending 6 months building something that might not ship?"**

Both are valid paths. But only one teaches you the skill that actually matters for side projects: **shipping things people want.**

---

## Pattern Identified: Solution Looking for Problem

**Surface request**: Build a feature-complete app

**Signals to recognize**:
- "I had an idea... thought it would be super cool"
- No research done upfront
- **Can't articulate core pain point when asked**
- Lists features before identifying who/why
- First-time builder with limited time
- Excitement-driven, not problem-driven

**Real problem**: Wants to build something, picked an idea that sounds good, hasn't validated it's worth 6 months of work

**Key questions to ask**:
1. What triggered this idea RIGHT NOW? (reveals spontaneous vs researched)
2. What's your track record with side projects? (reveals if serial starter or first-timer)
3. How much time can you realistically commit? (reveals if timeline is feasible)
4. Have you validated this with potential users? (reveals depth of validation)
5. **What's the ONE problem you're solving?** (reveals if they know the core pain point)

**Common pitfalls**:
- Taking feature list at face value (they described WHAT, not WHY)
- Not challenging lack of validation
- Missing that first-time builders underestimate shipping time
- Assuming excitement = validation
- Not asking about core pain point explicitly

**What unlocked it**: Q5 - "What's the ONE problem that frustrates you most?"

When they couldn't answer, the whole recommendation shifted. That's the signal that this is solution-first, not problem-first.

---

## User Validation

**User response to test**: (pending - this was a test scenario)

**What worked**:
- Pattern recognition in Tier 1 reframed from "what to build" to "should I build"
- Questions revealed lack of validation progressively
- Q5 was the breakthrough question that made the issue undeniable
- Recommendation was direct: "DON'T BUILD THIS YET"
- Gave two clear paths forward (validate first vs build to learn)

**What to improve**:
- Could have caught "solution looking for problem" pattern even earlier
- Might have asked about core pain point sooner (Q3 or Q4 instead of Q5)

---

## Question Framework Insights

### Question Type: Core Pain Point (New Category)

**When to use**: For product/build decisions, especially first-time builders

**Purpose**: Reveal whether user actually understands the problem they're solving

**Question**: "What's the ONE problem that frustrates you most?"

**What this reveals**:
- If they can't answer quickly → solution looking for problem
- If they give vague answer → weak validation
- If they give specific answer with examples → real pain point

**Example**: This test - user couldn't identify core pain point, revealed lack of validation

---

### Adaptive Questioning Pattern

**After Q2 revealed first-time builder:**
- Next question focused on time constraints (Q3)
- Then validation depth (Q4)
- Then core pain point (Q5)

**The flow**: Track record → Time → Validation → Core problem

This worked because each answer built on the previous to paint the picture.

---

## Learnings

1. **"I don't know" is a valid answer** - When user can't answer a question, that's often the breakthrough
2. **First-time builders need different advice** - No graveyard of abandoned projects, but also no experience with shipping reality
3. **Feature lists hide validation gaps** - Detailed solution description can mask that problem isn't validated
4. **Core pain point question is powerful** - If they can't answer, they're not solving a real problem
5. **Excitement ≠ Validation** - "Cool and useful" doesn't mean people will use it
