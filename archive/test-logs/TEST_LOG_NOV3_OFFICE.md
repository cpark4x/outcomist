# Outcomist Test - Home Office Redesign - Nov 3, 2025

**Test Type**: Real-world usage with home office redesign decision
**Tester**: Chris (user) with Claude Code
**Result**: ✅ PASS - Tier 2 discovery successfully identified real problem

---

## What Was Tested

### Tier 2 Discovery Flow
- One-by-one questioning pattern (from previous test feedback)
- 5 questions total (~10 minutes)
- Pattern recognition: "office redesign" → "personal sanctuary"
- Brief.md artifact generation

---

## Test Scenario

**User's Initial Request:**
> "let's use another example. how about i want to redesign my home office."

**Challenge**: This framed as a design/functionality problem, but discovery revealed it was actually an emotional/vibe problem.

---

## How the Session Went

### Tier 1: Pattern Recognition
- ✅ Identified pattern: "Office redesign" problems are usually about feeling, not function
- ✅ User engaged: "yes, let's map it out together"

### Tier 2: Discovery Questions (One-by-One)

**Question 1: What's not working?**
- User answer: "3, 5 - i just want a more functional and inspiring space that i feel proud and excited to work in"
- **Key insight**: Mentioned "feel proud and excited" - this is emotional, not functional

**Question 2: Renovation constraints?**
- User answer: "own the home -- but don't want to do that much work"
- Revealed: Low appetite for major renovation work

**Question 3: Budget?**
- User answer: "i want to buy stuff but don't want to do electrical, painting, construction. under $3-4 k"
- **Critical constraint**: Buy and place only, no labor/construction

**Question 4: How do you use the space?**
- User answer: "Mix of both? also want to move some of my personal things to this room so looking for more storage. i might also want to watch the game from this room"
- **BREAKTHROUGH MOMENT**: This isn't just a work office - it's becoming a personal retreat space
- Games + personal stuff = this is the user's 9:30pm-12am alone time sanctuary

**Question 5: What feels uninspiring?**
- User answer: "messy, cluttered, boring, vibe"
- **Confirmation**: All aesthetic/emotional complaints, not functional ones

### Analysis & Recommendation

**Pattern recognized**:
- User said "office redesign" but meant "create my personal sanctuary"
- The room needs to work for 9am Zoom calls AND 9:30pm game watching
- Real problem: 9:30pm-12am is their only alone time, but the room doesn't feel like THEIRS

**Recommendation delivered**: "Man Cave Refresh" (Not Office Redesign)
- Clear stance with brief reasoning (stayed under 20 lines)
- 5 next actions: Clear clutter, lighting, anchor piece, make it yours, sound system
- Budget breakdown aligned with $3-4K constraint

**User validation**: "okay that seemed to capture my core problem well"

## What Worked Well

### ✅ One-by-One Questioning
- User engaged with each question individually
- No complaints about pacing or format
- Previous test feedback validated

### ✅ Pattern Recognition Through Discovery
- Initial framing: "redesign my home office"
- Real problem revealed: "create a personal sanctuary that happens to have a desk"
- Questions #4 and #5 were critical for this shift

### ✅ Adaptive Questioning
- Question 4 revealed multi-use space (work + games + personal)
- Immediately recognized this changes everything
- Question 5 confirmed with "messy, cluttered, boring, vibe" (all emotional)

### ✅ Recommendation Clarity
- "Man Cave Refresh" reframe landed well
- Budget breakdown ($500-800 storage, $300-500 lighting, $1-2K anchor, $500-1K personal, $300-500 sound)
- Success metrics clear: "voluntarily spend 9:30pm time there" not "desk is ergonomic"

### ✅ Brief.md Generation
- Captured full discovery journey
- Context section documented constraints accurately
- Principles section ranked correctly: personal vibe > professional polish
- Recommendation section explained WHY this approach fits THEIR situation

## Key Learnings

### 1. Question 4 Was the Breakthrough

Before Q4:
- Seemed like a straightforward office optimization problem
- Budget and constraints were clear
- Missing the emotional core

After Q4:
- User revealed: games, personal storage, alone time space
- This isn't about work efficiency, it's about creating a retreat
- Recommendation completely changed direction

**The reveal**: "i might also want to watch the game from this room"

This ONE detail changed everything. Not a work office. A personal sanctuary.

### 2. "Messy, Cluttered, Boring, Vibe" = Gold

Question 5 asked for gut reaction, not function problems.

User could have said:
- "Desk is too small"
- "Monitor setup is awkward"
- "Chair hurts my back"

Instead they said: "messy, cluttered, boring, vibe"

**These are aesthetic/emotional complaints**, confirming the real problem isn't about optimizing work - it's about creating a space that feels good.

### 3. Multi-Use Space Reveals True Purpose

When user said "mix of both" (work modes) + games + personal storage, that revealed:
- This room serves multiple life domains
- It's not just "where I work from home"
- It's "my only personal space in the house"

The 9:30pm-12am alone time context made this click.

### 4. Budget + Constraints Tell a Story

User said:
- $3-4K budget
- No electrical/painting/construction
- Want to buy stuff but not do labor

This isn't someone who wants a massive renovation. They want **impact without disruption**. Buy things, place them, feel the change.

The recommendation aligned perfectly: 5 categories of purchases, no labor required.

## What Could Improve

### ⚠️ Question Ordering

Current flow:
1. What's not working?
2. Renovation constraints?
3. Budget?
4. How do you use the space?
5. What feels uninspiring?

**Better flow**:
1. How do you use the space? (gets multi-use context early)
2. What's not working? (with context of usage patterns)
3. What feels uninspiring? (emotional gut reaction)
4. Renovation constraints? (practical boundaries)
5. Budget? (final constraint)

**Why**: Getting usage patterns first (Q4 → Q1) would have revealed the multi-use nature earlier, making Q2 and Q5 more targeted.

### ⚠️ "Functional and Inspiring" Language

User said "functional and inspiring space I feel proud and excited about."

Could have probed deeper on "functional" vs "inspiring":
- "When you say functional, what specifically isn't working?"
- "When you say inspiring, what would that look and feel like?"

This might have surfaced the personal sanctuary insight even earlier.

## Test Metadata

**Duration**: ~10 minutes (Tier 1 + Tier 2)
**Questions asked**: 5 (within 5-7 target)
**Recommendation approach**: "Man Cave Refresh" (reframed problem)
**User validation**: ✅ "okay that seemed to capture my core problem well"
**Pattern compliance**: 100% (followed one-by-one questioning, trust-building pattern, Brief.md generation)

## Comparison to Previous Test (Health/Gym Scenario)

| Aspect | Health Scenario | Office Scenario |
|--------|----------------|-----------------|
| **Initial framing** | "Get healthy" | "Redesign office" |
| **Real problem revealed** | Schedule has no room for exercise | Need personal sanctuary, not work optimization |
| **Discovery insight** | Constraint recognition (no good solution exists) | Multi-use space reveals true purpose |
| **Recommendation** | Replacement strategy (swap unhealthy habits) | Reframe + budget breakdown |
| **User validation** | Switched scenarios mid-test | "Captured my core problem well" |

**Key difference**: Health scenario had NO good solution (schedule truly packed). Office scenario had a GREAT solution once we understood the real problem.

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Document this test in test log
2. ⚠️ Consider question ordering optimization (usage patterns → feelings → constraints)
3. ✅ Validate Brief.md artifact format with user
4. ⏳ Test with another scenario from test-scenarios.md
