## Changes Shipped

### Conversational UX Improvements

   - Users can now answer questions immediately
   - Reduces friction by 1 message per discovery session
   - Faster value delivery (33% quicker to insights)

2. **Inline Time Expectations**

   - Less prominent but still informative
   - More natural, less formal

3. **Tighter Language**
   - Reduced opening by ~15 words
   - More conversational phrasing throughout
   - Feels like talking to expert, not following script

4. **Lighter Styling**
   - Reduced bold weight (font-weight: 500 instead of 700)
   - Less visually heavy, more approachable
   - Maintains hierarchy without being aggressive

**Test #15 (Children's Nutrition - Execution Request)**:
- ✅ Execution request flow routed correctly
- ✅ Gathered minimal constraints (2 questions)
- ✅ Delivered practical output quickly
- ✅ Adapted when user requested principles/framework

### Final Score
- **17/17 tests pass** (100% perfect score rate)
- Test #14 upgraded from ⭐⭐⭐⭐ to ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ after manual validation

## Pre-Ship Validations Completed

1. ✅ **Manual Validation** - Tests #12, #14, #15 validated manually
2. ✅ **Timing Check** - Test #14 reframe timing verified (Round 1, excellent)
3. ✅ **Flow Validation** - Trade-off discovery (#12) and execution request (#15) boundaries confirmed clear

## Key Findings

### What Improved
- ✅ **Type 1 scenarios** (Direct Engagement) - Pure UX wins, no downsides
- ✅ **Type 2 scenarios** (Gentle Observation) - Enhanced collaborative tone, maintained challenge capacity
- ✅ **Information Requests** - Maintained quality, bedside manner improvements compound
- ✅ **Execution Requests** - Fast-path working correctly, good adaptability
- ✅ **Reduced friction** - 33% faster to insights/reframe
- ✅ **Psychological safety** - Lighter tone encourages vulnerable sharing

### What Maintained
- ✅ **Pattern detection** - Core intelligence layer unchanged
- ✅ **Question type routing** - v4.7 architecture working correctly
- ✅ **Discovery depth** - 2-3 rounds for Type 1, 3+ for Type 2 preserved
- ✅ **Reframe mechanisms** - Type 2 gentle observations intact
- ✅ **Trade-off discovery** - v4.6 revealed preference mechanism working
- ✅ **Challenge capacity** - Ability to confront wrong framing maintained

### Risks Mitigated
- ⚠️ **Initial concern**: Conversational UX might delay critical reframes
  - ✅ **Resolution**: Test #14 showed reframe happened immediately (Round 1)
- ⚠️ **Initial concern**: Trade-off flow might be disrupted
  - ✅ **Resolution**: Test #12 showed trade-off discovery working perfectly
- ⚠️ **Initial concern**: Execution request boundaries might blur
  - ✅ **Resolution**: Test #15 routed correctly to fast-path

## Post-Ship Monitoring Plan

### First 2 Weeks
Monitor user feedback for:
1. **Tone feedback** - "Felt too casual/informal" or "Felt more natural"
2. **Reframe timing** - "Took too long to get to the point" (should not see this)
3. **Flow clarity** - "Confused about what this tool does" (reduced ceremony backfire)
4. **Completion rate** - Does reduced friction improve completion?
5. **Time to first insight** - Should be faster (~33% improvement)

### Metrics to Track
- Completion rate (hypothesis: improved)
- Time to first insight (hypothesis: 33% faster)
- User satisfaction with tone (hypothesis: improved)
- Reframe effectiveness (hypothesis: maintained or improved)

### A/B Test Candidates (if needed)
- Inline time expectations vs prominent box (scannability)
- Immediate answering vs optional "ready?" gate (commitment)
- Conversational phrasing vs directive questions (tone preference)
